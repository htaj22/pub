3/1/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,I stopped using my wells Fargo account because Im XXXX they started to take out money even though I didnt have any transactions linked to that account I switched to XXXX XXXX XXXX all my bills moved to that one but money was still being taken out an charged to the wells Fargo account all the way up to now I just recently closed the account but it was negative {$860.00} an my savings was negative {$64.00} because of the over drafts which were scam transactions.
3/1/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"-On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to deposit a check in the amount of {$8900.00} through Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX  and received and error message stating that I was over the {$5000.00} daily mobile deposit limit. 

So I went to Well Fargo Branch # XXXX XXXX to deposit the check along with requesting {$250.00} cash back from transaction. The teller gave me my cash and advised that there would be a temporary hold on the check but I will have access to all of the funds XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a printed receipt showing that {$8700.00} would be delayed XXXX business days and that the date funds would be available is XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received an alert through Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Deposit Hold Alert Deposit Date XX/XX/XXXX Deposit Amount : {$8700.00} Amount Delayed : {$8700.00} Hold Reason : Unusual Deposit Account Activity Date Funds Will Be Available : XX/XX/XXXX -As of XX/XX/XXXX, I still do not have access to my funds. I contacted Wells Fargo and was advised by ( XXXX ) supervisors that XXXX  XXXX XXXX was holding up funds. 
Then a second supervisor stated that the issue was with the company that issued payment. Which was flat out lies. 

XXXX  XXXX XXXX and the party that issued payment confirmed confirmation that the check cleared. They also provided the BOA Sequence # XXXX along with WF transaction/sequence # as XXXX. 

This has caused a domino effect my transactions and use of my checking account in an attempt to cause me to incur overdraft fees. Wells Fargo is being deceptive in their business practices and illegally withholding my funds."
3/1/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"This is to inform this office that Wells Fargo has lied to this office in its response. 

I am referencing the response that states "" ... we have been unable to contact XXXX XXXX ''. 

That is a FRAUD. I have called on seven occasions. I have left messages. I have emailed. I was told by "" XXXX '' who left a message I would have an answer by XX/XX/XXXX. I was told five times I would receive a call in 24 hours. That was weeks ago. 

This is abuse upon abuse. 

My equity was STOLEN my life destroyed. My health destroyed. 

I am demanding the CFPB enforce the order and force repayment of all damages and further punish them for LYING To this body. 

HOW CAN YOU ALLOW WELLS FARGO TO FURTHER ANUSE AND LIE AND STEAL?"
3/1/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I tried to deposit a tax refund check from the internal revenue service on XX/XX/XXXX at the ATM at my local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, VA. The refund was long overdue and was in the name of the trust established by my now deceased mother and father, the XXXX Trust. The Trust had an account established at that Wells Fargo for more than a year. The deposit was in the amount of {$22000.00} so it was already difficult that it had taken the IRS years to process and provide the refund check ( long enough that my mother passed away in the interim ). 

When I deposited the check, I was presented with a message telling me that Wells Fargo would not deposit the check and would not return the check to me. They may as well have taken it from my hands and run away. After calling their customer service number and waiting on hold ( and being late for work ), they told me that all I could do was file a complaint and wait 10 days. 

Apparently, I need to wait that long to find out whether the bank will steal my deceased mother 's money or not. I can't believe this is allowed to happen. The check was from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service- not a shady, offshore organization. I don't understand how they can keep that large sum of money with no justification or explanation. It is a lot of money to need to worry may not be returned. If an individual did this, the authorities would take them into custody."

The stove did not arrive and XXXX XXXX said that they could not schedule a delivery nor could they give me a refund until the stove was returned to inventory. XXXX XXXX said the stove was on a truck waiting to be delivered. XXXX XXXX refused to cancel the order. I ordered another stove and had it installed in time for XXXX. I filed a claim with my bank Wells Fargo and was given a temporary credit for {$720.00} while they investigate. I received notice that Wells Fargo had completed their investigation and the credit was permanent. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX finally refunded my money. Wells Fargo did not take the credit back on that day instead they sent me a letter that I received last week stating that they would take the credit on XXXX XXXX. The issue that I had with that date is that I don't get my paycheck direct deposited until XX/XX/XXXX. I called multiple times to get the date moved but was told that the system generated the date. I questioned why the system would generate a date before my paycheck was direct deposited if not for me to incur excessive fees. I made multiple calls and was finally told that they had successfully moved the date and that I would not incur any fees associated with them taking the credit back. However, those were both lies. The credit was taken on XX/XX/XXXX and I have since incurred multiple fees because all the recurring payments that I already had set up have been returned and my account in now in the negative for almost {$750.00} and the amount is still going up."

Maybe Wells Fargo should have allowed more time for those conditions to be met also since it takes so long to set up a direct deposit by the social security administration.

3/1/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Traveler's check or cashier's check,Lost or stolen check,None,"I brought a cashier check at Wells Fargo located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX on XX/XX/2023 for the amount of XXXX $ pay to a specific company. However the check was cashed on XX/XX/2023. The payee has not received it in their account. I went back to the branch for the copy of the check that has been cashed out. There was no endorsement at the back and I was told you could cash out a check without an endorsement using the app! The banker XXXX XXXX and another XXXX man were laughing regarding my questions about getting my money back since the bank paid to someone who is not the payee on the check. It was not to my awareness that anybody could cash a cashier check without an endorsement even the person is not the payee on the check. It is the bank responsibility to ensure that the fund is deposited only to the person payable to. The person I wanted to pay has confirmed that the check was not received and that it was not in the account and would like to confirm the last 4 account number that the check was deposited to but the bankers said they can not release that information until the claim department takes the case. It would take 10-30 business days. There is something wrong with the way the bank handle business. The cashier check should be the safest way where one can used to make a payment as it is drawn from the banks fund and it should know whether it was deposited to the payee correctly or not. I was told fraud is minimal using cashier check. The bankers asked me why I dont wire transfer or pay other methods instead of using the cashier check. The mistake is on the bank as they allowed the fund to be released even with no endorsement and the bank should be responsible in restoring my money back as they did not pay to the specific person I addressed on the check. If all the banks in US works this way then it is no point to mention on the check whom to payable to as anybody can cash the check using the app. The bank app must have a validation process to ensure that the check is deposited to the correct person. I hope you would look into this issue otherwise it would promote more check fraudulent activities in this country."

3/1/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"There was a dispute over two transactions with Wells Fargo on my Business Line of Credit. I was formerly working with what I initially thought was a professional advertising/publishing company, which turned out to be a 'vanity publishing/book fair ' scam. I realized this was the case before the company, XXXX XXXX, was set to provide certain services in the Fall of 2022 -- As soon as I was made aware of their horrible predatory practices ( mostly used upon self-publishing authors of advanced age ) and experienced some of their poor, unprofessional and unethical treatment myself, I submitted my clear cancellation to them in writing about one month before the deadline. 

Wells Fargo kept me waiting for months while they researched the dispute, and my staff put together a thorough letter ( attached below ) clearly laying out documentation and the order in which things happened and submitted it to Wells Fargo dispute team. Weeks after that, I received a dispute decision that they were upholding the fraudulent charges, with no proper explanation or even reference to the documents I had submitted in which XXXX XXXX admits fault in relation to their own 'contract '. I called Wells Fargo following this dispute to let them know I would be contacting the CFPB. 

Thank you for your time and assistance in resolving this matter. I hope my experience can help others avoid this humiliating experience. I encourage other self-publishing authors to consider that a successful and legitimate publishing company will never cold call you at home or solicit you via email ; This is what I have learned through this terrible experience. Literary agents should assist with all publishing, authors need to be wary of all solicitations by phone or email, and deeply research any company that they consider working with."

3/1/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I am filing another complaint because Wells Fargo Bank continues to misrepresent the truth in my case. The latest correspondence came today XXXX. Again they stated, as per their tape recordings, that I only applied for a {$20000.00} and never asked for a {$10000.00} as I have asserted over the last year. In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a {$10000.00} loan with loan consultant XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated since my house is almost paid for, I should borrow {$100000.00}. I told him that I am a XXXX senior on a fixed income and I can only afford to pay back {$10000.00}. He began to badger me and tried to force to borrow {$75000.00} which I also refused and refused his next offer of {$50000.00}. He continued his rude tactics trying to force me to borrow $ XXXX.At that point I informed him that I have a XXXX XXXX and he is causing me to have an XXXX XXXX. He continued and told me that. I was not going to get a {$10000.00} loan because there would be no benefit in keeping the loan at {$10000.00} due to the closing cost being rolled over into the new mortgage. This is evidenced in the correspondence submitted dated XX/XX/XXXX on page two, third paragraph. The fact that XXXX XXXX also tried to force me to borrow more than I could afford to pay back is evidenced n the correspondence submitted dated XX/XX/XXXX, on page two, third paragraph, where Case Specialist XXXX XXXX stated that XXXX XXXX recommended the higher amounts to save me on out of pocket closing cost The correspondence today again insisted that their tape recordings prove that I only asked for a {$20000.00} and never asked for a {$10000.00} loan which is totally false. I asked for copies of these tapes as per the Freedom of Information and The Open Records act but my request was refused."
3/1/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"On XX/XX/2023, I received a notification from the credit bureau that my payments are past due with Wells Fargo. I know for a fact that I always made payments ahead of time. However, when I asked my wife if she has received any credit card statements from Wells Fargo, she informed that she has not received any statements for quite sometime. As a matter of fact she said, we only received about 4 statements since the inception of this credit card. I contacted Wells Fargo customer service and informed me that my case has been transferred to Wells Fargo collection. I am confused because I never received any phone call or letter from Wells Fargo collection. And yet the first I am hearing of a past due account is through a credit report. Wells Fargo never communicated with me to rectify this problem. When I brought this issue to the customer service and also to the collections person, they just did not care. As a consumer I am expected to be perfect since this affects my credit report. However, I also expect Wells Fargo to respect my right as a consumer and send me my billing statement and give me a chance to fix the problem. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo never respected my right as a consumer. I paid the total amount already which will be received tomorrow. I worked hard for my credit score. Hence, I am requesting CFPB to assist me in removing that past due on my credit report since I never received my credit card statements nor was I informed of a past due amount."

3/2/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo forced me to quick sell my house. 
They violated section 50 of the Texas constitution. 

*Wells Fargo ( WF ) took over the serving of our mortgage. 
*Our payment was XXXX XXXX. 
*WF paid our property taxes, without notifying us, and without asking us if we needed help. 
*WF raised our monthly payment to over XXXX  XXXX, and sent us a new monthly statement. This included our mortgage payment plus our new accrued property tax payment, plus the amount to pay back the current property taxes. 
*I contacted WF by phone to inquire how our monthly payment went so high, and they explained the above. I told them I wouldnt be able to afford this payment.

*The Home Affordability Act was in place, and we needed help. XXXX XXXXy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX nearly went out of business, my wife lost her job, and our house had drastically dropped in value. We needed help. 
*We made the XXXX  XXXX payment for 7-8 months, and every month I would call WF and tell them we needed help from one of the current government programs that were available at the time. Each time Id explain this to WF, their representatives would tell me I needed to stop making my payments for 90 days! And then, they could help me! At this point Id never even been late for a payment, and my credit score was very good. 
*Finally, after making 7-8 monthly payments I called WF and they again told me they could help me after I stop making payments. 
*we stopped paying, and started through their processes of determining how they could help. Sometimes they would tell me we made too much money, and the next day a different representative would tell us we do t make enough. 
*They kept making us redo our financials, and wed wait and wait to hear from them, and they wouldnt ever reach back out to us. Months would go by, and we would call WF, and theyd say we need to update the financials AGAIN. 
*In total, we updated our financials for them at least 9 times over a course of about 13 months. 
*WF finally said they could lower our payment by {$30.00}! 
*They Federal Expressed the new documents to our home, and told me we had to sign the documents or lose the house. The girl in the phone told me, what choice do you have now. At least sign the documents and then stop paying again, and start the whole process over, AGAIN! 
*we signed the documents and XXXX them back in the packet THEY provided. 
*we decided we were going to sell our house and move. 
*while talking to our realtor, she told us this did not seem right, and told us to go XXXXXXXX section 50 of the Tx constitution *we went straight home that day and did this. 
*there was an attorney here in XXXX who was pulling together a class action lawsuit over this very issue. 
*I called and spoke to him, and explained everything. He asked me to come to his office THAT day to show him our documents. I did, and he said, WF definitely violated the constitution in our case! He further asked us to join his lawsuit as THE named plaintiffs, David and Tracy Hawkins vs Wells Fargo Bank. He expected this to be a class action lawsuit. 
*We did everything he told us to do, and we tried suing the bank. 
*This went on for several months before we went to court for an initial hearing. 
*In our hearing, our attorney seemed very nervous and unorganized, and he explained to me later that he got everything on record that neede to get on record. The banks attorneys ( 5-6 total ) were very organized, and seemed confident they were going to beat us up. 
*Our attorney lost another case, and told everyone in our lawsuit that we needed to prepare to lose our homes because the lawsuit he just lost would have a bad outcome on our lawsuit. 
*a couple days later, our attorney reached out to me and told me he would like to move forward with our case as an individual case. In the conversation, he explained he needed to get paid for his time for this new case, and he wanted to start immediately by reviewing all our documents. 
*In the attempt to understand, I said, you mean the documents youve had on you desk all these months? This made him mad, and he hung up on me. 
*I reached out to his partner, and his partner told me they didnt want to work with me anymore! 
*A couple days later I was driving in my car, and my attorney called me and screamed at me to sign a document he had emailed over the night before. I told him I hadnt read it yet, and in a very angry voice he told me to sign the document. It was a withdrawal from the WF lawsuit, and it was written EXTREMELY one sided to WF. 
*My attention screamed at me that this is the best deal we would get, because otherwise WF was coming after us for hundreds of thousands of dollars for their attorneys fees and expenses! 
*my attorney was extremely upset, and we finally signed the document. 
*WF then forced us into a quick sale, and we lost our house."
3/2/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"In XXXX, we contacted Wells Fargo to do a loan modification due to the economy and several houses around us going into default. This naturally led our home 's value to plummet. We were simply told they could not help us... because we were not in default on our loan. XXXX of XXXX, my husband lost his job. Just a few weeks before that, we had requested again for our loan to be modified, only to be told again that we were not in default, so there was nothing they could do for us. When my husband lost his job, and we had a XXXXyear old child, having this house was no longer a priority for us, so as Wells Fargo suggested XXXX we went into default on the loan. We contacted them again and after looking up our loan and seeing we were late on our payment, they said they could help us. That was until they found out my husband had lost his job, then they couldn't help again. So we decided to short sale the house. This process started in XXXX of XXXX and we had a buyer in XXXX of XXXX. Wells Fargo would send us letters that they were unable to get a hold of us, and were therefore denying our Pre-Foreclosure Sale, yet we never received phone calls from them. We were not without phones ( mobile or landline ) and any time we tried to call them, we would get the runaround. But we received a letter in XXXX of XXXX and XXXX of XXXX stating they were proceeding with the foreclosure because they could not get a hold of us. Before this, we received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX saying we may be eligible for Payment Relief, of which we called the number on the letter, but the number put us in a phone message loop. They took so long to finally approve the short sale, that the buyer had pulled out of the deal. We received a letter in XXXX of XXXX that the house was going to be auctioned off if we did not bring the mortgage up to date. This was after two attempts by us to have Wells Fargo approve a short sale. By this time, we had moved out of the house. We received a letter in XXXX of XXXX that they would like to work with us on payment options- almost a year later! All we wanted by this time was to just start over. We had gone through so much stress with them, we just wanted to be done with them forever. We later found out we were part of the "" rubber stamp '' letters.

3/2/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX I initiated a domestic wire from my personal checking account using the Wells Fargo online banking system. The amount was for {$10.00} and was intended to ensure I had all the correct instructions to send funds to my elderly mothers new investment account. She is selling her house in early XXXX and we needed to be sure the wiring instructions we provide to the closing agent are correct. 
At around XXXX pm I checked the status of the wire using the online banking system, and it was listed as pending. I then called Wells customer service line, which uses voice authentication to verify my identity, to ask when the wire would be released. The customer service representative proceeded to give me 5 different responses for when the wire would be released : 1-3 days ; possibly today ; 90 % go the same day ; definitely today ; and, should go today. At no point did he say anything about suspected fraud. In addition, none of his responses aligned with the written commitment on the online Compare Options page for funds transfers, which states that domestic wires are delivered same day. I ended the call and planned to continue monitoring my wire online the rest of the day.

After checking online at approximately XXXX pm and noticing the wire was still pending I called the customer service number again. This time I spoke with someone named XXXX. He indicated the wire was so small it triggered a fraud alert. I asked why no one had contacted me, especially given the same day delivery statement on Wells funds transfer online page. He did not answer my question, instead telling me he disabled my online access and that I needed to go to a branch. At no point in the conversation did he attempt to resolve my problem ; it appeared to me he gave no consideration to the possibility the fraud alert could be a false positive and perhaps providing customer service was part of his job. He then hung up on me suddenly as I was trying to ask him questions. My online access had been working just moments before, and my identity had been verified at the beginning of the call, so I feel he disabled my online access because I kept asking him questions out of anger or retaliation, perhaps, rather than because he had any legitimate concern I was in fact a fraudster. 
After XXXX hung up on me I immediately called back to XXXX customer service number at approximately XXXX pm. XXXX transferred me to the Fraud group, where XXXX also told me to go to a branch the next morning. I told her I wanted to register a complaint. She gave me a long alpha-numeric complaint ID, which I wasnt able to correctly write down. Once again, I got absolutely no help from Wells, and in my opinion they considered me to be either a fraudster or just generally someone they werent willing to help. They didnt see me as someone with a problem, but rather as a problem to be dispensed with. 
By this point I was very frustrated. At XXXX pm I called Wells one last time. XXXX in Fraud told me the same thing : go to a branch the next morning. I told him I was specifically interested in why no one from Fraud had contacted me when fraud was detected. Why did I have to initiate all contact with Wells, and why did I need to go to a branch to get a fraud question answered when I was already speaking with Fraud? XXXX said the branch personnel could answer my questions. I considered that a complete lie. 
The next morning, Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I left work and went to a branch near my office. XXXX XXXX verified my ID, got on the phone with someone and restored my online access. While he still had someone from XXXX on the phone I told him that the customer service rep said he could tell me why the XXXX group had not contacted me. Neither he nor the individual on the phone could give me an answer, only that XXXX should contact account holders within XXXX hours of suspected fraud ( at the time of writing this, it is more than XXXX hours and no one from XXXX has contacted me ). XXXX and the individual on the phone asked if I wanted to send the original wire or cancel it. They did not offer to waive the {$30.00} fee, and when I asked XXXX if he would waive it he said no. I canceled the wire. Before I left the branch XXXX said he would have his XXXX call me the next day when she returned to the office. 
On Wednesday morning, XX/XX/XXXX, the branch XXXX, XXXX XXXX, called me at XXXX am. She is the only person who has displayed any measure of understanding that the service Ive received from XXXX was poor. I appreciate her apology on behalf of the XXXX group, but XXXX is a huge organization and she doesnt speak for them. However, she did provide me with XXXX additional complaint numbers : XXXX and XXXX. She also told me someone from XXXX XXXX XXXX would call me in XXXX hours ( i.e., by mid-day Friday, XX/XX/XXXX ). 
In summary, I would like more information on the following questions regarding my experience : Why was I not contacted when suspected fraud was detected on my account? 
XXXX I expect better service when I pay {$30.00} for a service that clearly has a high profit margin? 
What was the timeline for detecting the suspected fraud on my account and disabling my online access? I want to be assured I was not treated improperly by XXXX. 
Why is the written standard for executing a domestic online wire ( same day ) different from the timeline for informing an account holder fraud is suspected and the wire will not be sent ( XXXX hours )? 
Does XXXX have any procedure to determine whether a suspected fraud detected by an automated algorithm is in fact a false positive and the customer should be engaged and the problem rectified? 
I have banked with Wells Fargo since XXXX and stayed with them throughout their many problems. I now plan to change banks because of the way I was treated by the individuals in the XXXX group."

I went to my local Wells Fargo Branch to get a debt consolidation loan. The clerk that helped me told me to get a credit card instead. I told them I would not qualify for a credit card due to my income and debt situation. I really wanted a debt consolidation loan. Instead, the person helping me filled out the credit card application with a fraudulent income. An amount far higher than my actual income. They told me to pay my bills with the credit card and then we could get a debt consolidation in the future. I used the card and went back a few months later and they declined me for a debt consolidation loan. Later, I couldn't pay for my credit card ( that I shouldn't have been given ) and defaulted. Wells Fargo got a judgment for the balance. Later, when Wells Fargo was national news for opening fake accounts, Wells Fargo contacting me AND PAID ME {$4000.00}!!!! I thanked them and did not join the class action lawsuit! They said the were just trying to make things right. Now, 4 years later, they are trying to Garnish {$54000.00} from my account. XXXX XXXX, the wells Fargo attorneys say I owe {$27000.00}. 

In summary, Wells Fargo opened a fraudulent account, paid me {$4000.00} to apologize so I wouldn't join the class action lawsuit.

3/3/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,I believe I am apart of the Wells Fargo settlement and I havent been contacted yet i my mortgage was financed through them in 2011 and they did an unlawful loan modification to keep from foreclosing on my home and now I cant draw equity because it put a {$36000.00} lien on my home which I wasnt aware of when I signed up for the loan modification
3/3/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I secured an assumable mortgage in XXXX. Wells Fargo was selected by the mortgagor to service that mortgage. In XXXX, I endeavored to assume that mortgage as an individual, rather than as a married couple, as part of a divorce agreement. Wells Fargo required that I have a Debt to Income Ratio DTI ) of no less than 43 %, As I didn't have sufficient income, I secured two separate non-occupying co-borrower to submit the assumption application along with me. Both times, the co-borrowers were rejected -- once in writing and once verbally, because no matter their income ( both had annual incomes in excess of {$250000.00} per year ), I still had to satisfy the DTI of 43 %. The income of the co-borrowers was not considered in either of the two applications I filed. As a result, I was left with no choice but to terminate the mortgage. 

I believe the CFPB should investigate the DTIs required by mortgage servicers, as they effectively make any older or retired worker incapable of taking advantage of an assumable loan that they'd secured at a previous time. As a result of the unreasonably high DTI and the servicers ' refusal to consider the income of a non-occupying co-borrower, the loans are no longer truly assumable. 

Under XXXX XXXX rules, had I sought to secure a refinanced mortgage, the non-occupying co-borrowers ' income would have been sufficient for me to meet the DTI requirement. However, as a loan assumption, apparently the mortgage servicer was not required to incorporate the non-occupying co-borrowers ' income, thus effectively negating the assumability of that mortgage."

I was hesitant because people are pulling scams like this, so I asked what the last 4 digits of the card were, and he told me XXXX, which is correct. He told me that before sending me the new card ( ending in XXXX ), I'd have to set up a new PIN for it via an automated voice system. He transferred me to the automated system where I typed my new PIN into the system -- this PIN was different than the PIN from my debit card ending in XXXX. After that, I was transferred back to this Wells Fargo person and he said he would rush mail me my new debit card. I was hesitant throughout the conversation w/him because I was afraid it could be a scam, and he asked me if anything was wrong at the end of the call. I said I was worried it could be a scam, but that I hadn't given him any important info, and he said something along the lines of that it wasn't a scam and they were trying to protect me, so we parted ways.

3/3/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I would like to file a complaint against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. My complaint is in regards to the recent settlement awarded to conusmers, whereby, as part of a {$3.00} billion settlement, Wells Fargo has agreed to pay more than {$2.00} billion directly to customers harmed by illegal activity, ranging from incorrect overdraft fees to wrongful foreclosures. I believe we are a part of the wrongful foreclosure portion as we had our home foreclosed which was sold in XXXX of XXXX. I have attached the letter that I submitted to Wells Fargo regarding this issue and I was notified today, XX/XX/XXXX, that we did not qualify for to be included in this settlement. My concern is that they research our circumstances for approximately 6 weeks and the called today to inform that they were sending out a letter stating we did not qualify but that they can not disclose to us as to why. I question the service representative that I am entitled to an answer as to why we don't qualify and she refused to answer my questions because she said that due to legislation and regulations she was prohibited from giving me an answer. I was adamant that I was seeing their refusal as being suspicious and she just read a letter that she claimed she pulled from our file that was not even related to the time period that is in question. Our situation is complicated and started in XX/XX/XXXX when our son was diagnosed with a rare XXXX XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I initiated contact with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to inform them of our impending crises and they offered to do a loan modification and at that time they said during such a request we were not allowed to make payments. Our mortgage was current when we initially applied for this assistance. My issue is that we were put through this loan modifcation process 4-5 times over the course of the next 7 or 8 months. The end result is that we were told we were approved for the modification and that we would be receiving our loan papers to sign agreeing to the modification. This was between XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. Wells Fargo said that we would receive our paper within a week and that they would be expedited via express mail, and we were under a time restriction to follow through otherwise if we missed the deadline to send them back the modification would be void. Upon never receiving our paper work I called back and we were told that no modification had ever been approved for us and during our sons XXXX XXXX treatment and countless surgeries, we were verbally abused and told to vacate our home otherwise we were facing eviction and as I was told "" don't be surprised if you find your personal belongings outside ''. Wells Fargo illegally and wrongfully foreclosed on on our home. We were forced to stop making payments due the modification process we were going through. We did move out of our home under the circumstances with our son going through XXXX. All this is outlined in the letter I sent to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and I would like to know why they are refusing to communicate with me as to why we don't qualify for this settlement process. I feel that we do because we were mislead and literally lied to. In the manner on how they are addressing me with this issue Wells Fargo has not changed how they conduct themselves and I feel that they are treating me the same way that I was treated back then. Our home was sold in XXXX of XXXX so we still had an account with them under the conditions set forth in this settlement. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is not looking at the time line I provided and instead are looking at something that I don't even know about. Our son was diagnosed in XXXX of XXXX and I did not set forth a modification process executed by them until then so I am confused as to why they are trying to link something that I am not aware of with the time period I was concerned with which is from XX/XX/XXXX to when our home was sold, in XXXX of XXXX, and our subsequent bankruptcy in XXXX to alleviate the debt incurred from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, selling our home at a loss rather than working with us. Staff at XXXX XXXX XXXX we perplexed and at a loss for words that in the midst of our son fighting for his life with XXXX, that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, would put us on the street. We were weeks from becoming homeless with a child with XXXX. This is morally wrong, ethically mean, and totally uncalled for when all we were asking for was a little help. I feel we should be included in this settlement and I feel that a different party should review our circumstances."

3/3/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I recently read an online article on XXXX titled Wells Fargo might owe you money and how to get it. As I read through the short article I realized that it directly involved our mortgage loan with Wells Fargo we had years ago and how we were treated by Wells Fargo through their "" Home Preservation XXXX. '' The entire position and title are a complete joke because all this XXXX ever did was deny us 4 times for a requested loan modification due to mounting bills and the loss of a job. 

In XXXX of XXXX I lost a job I had held for 16 years and accounted for 60 % of our household income. As soon I was able to get unemployment benefits I called Wells Fargo to get a loan modification due to loss of income in order to save our house. After sending in all required documents it was determined we still had too much income to qualify for the modification. 

About a year later I applied again for a loan modification once my unemployment benefits ran out and I was turned down again for the modification because this time we didn't have enough income to qualify. 

Our financial situation continued to deteriorate due to the inability to pay all of our bills. I soon cashed out my XXXX approximately {$35000.00} after taxes to replace the roof on the house. The roof on the house was in poor condition and we had several leaks throughout the house. The stucco on the house was in bad condition as well so we went ahead and used some more of the money to replace the stucco. We used what was leftover to continue making our mortgage payments while I was looking for employment. 

The job market at the time was not good and the only way I had to make was as a food delivery driver. The extra money was running out and it was only a matter of time until we were unable to make a full payment on the mortgage. For a third time I call and explain our situation and apply again for a loan modification explaining that we were in imminent danger of default. For a third time we were denied a loan modification because we didn't have enough income. 

We continue to struggle a while longer and it seems as though a miracle XXXX help us save our house. For years we were part of a XXXX action lawsuit against Wells Fargo for their pick-a-payment loan. Our loan originated with XXXX and Wells Fargo bought out XXXX and assumed their liabilities which included this law suit. Wells Fargo settled the law suit and part of the settlement agreement was to give these borrowers a loan modification to get out of the pick-a-payment loans they were still in. 

I call my Home Preservation XXXX and explain to her that we were part of the class action law suit and per the settlement agreement would like to begin our loan modification as promised. I was told that that made no difference and we still did not qualify for any loan modification or loan forgiveness. I exclaimed, "" you can't be serious ... my wife and I are owed a loan modification as stated in the settlement agreement. '' I was told, I am sorry sir, there is nothing I can do for you. 

From that point we couldn't pay our bills any longer and we went to see a Bankruptcy lawyer. XXXX of her first questions was do you want to save your home? I said after the way we had been treated by Wells Fargo, I didn't ever want to do any business with them ever again. She stated then don't make another payment and let the Bankruptcy process take its course. This was the summer of XXXX. 

We went through the Bankruptcy and towards the end of the process we were contacted about signing over the house in a Deed in lieu of Foreclosure instead of going through the arduous task of going through an actual Foreclosure. We agreed to this agreement, settled our timeline to be out of the house and began packing.

I collected information on how to file a complaint. The process seemed daunting but to my surprise it was not too bad.
3/3/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"Roughly 15 years ago I acquired an equity line with Wells Fargo. The debt was supposed to be for no more than 15 years with 8 % interest. In XXXX I asked for help to reduce the interest but unfortunately they denied my request. In XXXX I called again because on the mobile application for Wells Fargo was not accepting my payments. When I had called they said that there was no problem at all and to keep paying as usual. They told me that at the end of the XXXX mark they would send me an official letter stating that they would resolve the changes. in XXXX, I called again reducing the interest or at least refinancing and again the denied my request. The lady I spoke with that day asked me Why, when I was about to finish in XXXX of XXXX. However, in XXXX I believe I received a letter stating that my finishing in XXXX was incorrect but it was actually going to be in XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I wanted to may a payment but the app would not accept it. In XXXX I received a bill for 1 CENT. So my son tried to pay it on the app and once again would not take. He called to report it and they said they would look into it. Later that month I received a phone call stating that I still owed {$38000.00}. Even though I made sure to make all payments, even though some were possibly 3 days late I still made sure to pay extra. We called and they said they would look into it and we never heard anything from them again. I have the name and numbers from some of the associates I spoke with that told me that I would be finished in XXXX. 
Most of my payments have been through mobile pay, after we left XXXX XXXX XXXX and moved to Wells Fargo."
3/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,I opened a banking account with WellsFargo sometime in XXXX when I was in college. A few years later I went into a WellsFargo branch and closed the College Checking account and moved to a different bank. I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX from WellsFargo alerting me that I will be charged monthly fees for an account not maintaining a balance of {$500.00} or a {$25.00} dollar qualifying direct deposits. This is for an account that was closed years ago. In the time from XXXX until now I have never received any correspondence concerning this account that was presumably closed after I physically went into a Wellsfargo branch and closed the account. Why am I receiving a letter over ten years after closing the account? There appears to be a balance of {$3.00}. I do not bank with wellsfargo and never intend to in the future.
3/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I have a problem with Wells Fargo I issued a complaint last month but apparently, I had the wrong date. It was actually XXXX XX/XX/2012. I had just returned home from the hospital after an illness on XXXX XXXX,2012. The morning of XX/XX/XXXX I went online to check the status of my checking account & noticed that my checking account was empty. The bank had allowed XXXX to withdraw approximately {$1000.00} which was part of my social security. I was also charged {$100.00} for this service. Wells Fargo notified me that XXXX tried to withdraw an additional {$400.00} but they refused to do that. I want to know why they gave my money to XXXX on one occasion but not the other time. I was under the impression that only the IRS could take my money. I wasn`t aware of cfpb until my son told me last month. I appreciate your help in solving this problem. Thanking you in advance. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
3/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XXXX XXXX, 2023, there were two unauthorized transactions that posted on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX and XXXX. Wells Fargo investigated and posted {$550.00} to my checking account on XXXX XXXX, 2023 reimbursing the full amount that was stolen. 

The second unauthorized transaction occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amounts of {$2200.00} and {$1700.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo has DENIED this claim TWICE. 

An unauthorized online funds transfer of {$15000.00} from Savings to checking also occurred. I reversed the transfer myself thus closing the claim. 

A previous debit card was closed XXXX/XXXX/23 due to confirmed fraud. A new card was mailed on XXXX/XXXX/23. It was activated on XXXX/XXXX/23. This card was closed on XXXX/XXXX/23 due to fraud. 

A new card was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX23. This card was closed the same day due to fraud. 

A new card was mailed XX/XX/XXXX/23. It has not been activated and I changed banks because of lack of confidence and incompetence. I Also changed account numbers in this process. I'm not sure of the date. 

At least twice, I received fraudulent phone calls and false claim numbers, claiming to be from Wells Fargo, that were asking for personal information. The banker I was working with at Wells Fargo during the fraudulent activity,, told me I could trust the Wells Fargo person on the other end of the phone call if they were calling from the number on the back of my card. This proved not to be true. shortly after, He no longer works there. I received poor direction in handling this breach on several occasions. 

Wells Fargo has refused to use common sense. My checking and card accounts were fraudulently hacked several times. They are insisting I authorized transactions from XXXX. I need help in returning over {$4000.00} that belongs to me."

3/4/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"My husband an I have tried 4 times to receive a loan modification with Welles Fargo for our mortgage. Twice they told our attorney that they did not receive XXXX packages of documents sent through certified mail and XXXX XXXX. On our third attempt they claimed the same thing and then on our last attempt they denied us. This started at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and ended at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. My husband experienced a very serious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX. This placed an enormous amount of pressure on us financially which is why we applied for the loan modification. Welles Fargo were both delinquent and negligent in the handling of our request. They have also charged off our second mortgage so it has been difficult for us to refinance.We are working with a mortgage specialist to try to fix this, however we feel it is important to file this complaint as well."
3/4/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"I received a loan from WellsFargo to start my medical practice. I am personally liable for the loan for my LLC, not the business itself. The payments etc appear on my personal credit report. 

I was supposed to receive a line of credit with the loan, but that never materialized. 

When I make extra payments, I request that the payment due date be advanced. WellsFargo has not applied any of my payments as I requested. They have said it is because the payments are not associated with an invoice, but no bank sends out old payment coupons anymore. WellsFargo does not generate electronic invoices in advance. They create a system where I can not pay an advanced payment, despite me wanting to do so. I even tried placing the month and date in the memo section. 

I called WellsFargo again on XX/XX/ XXXX. I reached XXXX. XXXX refused to understand my issue. She became upset and disconnected the call, when I stated her answers were not to my questions. XXXX stated the payments are applied by a computer. Any over payment is applied to the principal, but does not advance my payment date. I kept explaining that is exactly what I do not want to happen. I want the payment date advanced, unless I tell someone to apply it to principal and not advance the payment date. 

I like to have a cushion in payments in case something unexpected occurs. They rob me of my ability to manage my finances in the way that best suits me. They take away my right to apply the extra payments as I wish."

3/4/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I filed 3 complaints with the CFPB over the span of a couple years regarding the wrongful foreclosure of my home. The answers to the complaints danced around the mistakes made by Wells Fargo and their attorneys, and they specifically admit to the mistakes in some of their correspondence. There are several reasons this foreclosure happened and continued when it should not have. 

CFPB rules state a mortgage must be 120 days late before being referred to foreclosure. Wells Fargo placed my account on disaster relief for 60 days in XXXX of XXXX Letters from Wells Fargo state disaster relief will end XX/XX/XXXX. My account was referred to foreclosure and defaulted on XX/XX/XXXX 5 days after the disaster relief ended. They offered no loss mitigation options and had already begun working on the foreclosure as if I was never in disaster relief. In fact, letters from Wells Fargo indicated they would default on my mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX which a ) was far less than 120 days delinquent b ) was on disaster relief. Despite being referred to foreclosure, I was approved for a forbearance with XXXX trial payments of {$25.00} a month for 3 months. Despite receiving my 2nd payment of {$25.00} they cancelled the trial period and rescinded their offer for forbearance. Evidence of receiving this payment can be seen on the foreclosure worksheet where the {$25.00} payment was held in a special account, despite their claims it was never received. Furthermore, In a correspondence from Wells Fargo they actually say that they were not allowed to accept the {$25.00} payment I sent for the forbearance BECAUSE the account was sent to foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. So, they admit to not accepting my payment. 

My loan was securitized bundled and sold to XXXX XXXX despite having any proper documentation supporting this. 
Call Stop - In my first complaint to the CFPB you can see the RESPONSE from WF which says they can not reach me to solve the problem. But as Ive attached WF internal emails discussing my complaint to CFPB you can see where XXXX XXXX PUT A CALL STOP ON MY ACCOUNT PREVENTING ME FROM SPEAKING TO ANYONE on the same dates they claim cant reach me. Its no coincidence the call stop end date is XX/XX/XXXX which is the original date of the foreclosure sale. This was absolutely done deliberately so that I could not speak with anyone and prevent the sale from happening. 

CFPB guidelines state 1 point of contact when working with home preservation - not only could I not get through to anyone on the phone because of a call stop, I was assigned more than 4 different point of contacts over several months. Each of which ceased communication without reason. I was repeatedly told my file was incomplete, or once everything was sent in, more and more documents would be requested. Letters to the court from their attorneys state they they had a completed application for loan modification but that I decided to not move forward with this. Why would I spend years trying to get this done only to say I decided not to move forward? 

Wells Fargo foreclosed on my property despite claiming that they did not. Wells Fargo assigned my mortgage to XXXX loan servicing in XX/XX/XXXX and would not communicate any information from that point forward. Similarly, When I contacted XXXX loan servicing they told me to contact wells fargo. My only option was to file Bankruptcy to attempt to save my home and the foreclosure was suspended. After my bankruptcy was dismissed, Wells Fargo reopened the foreclosure case. WF attorneys moved forward with foreclosure pushing for an auction sale date, although WF denied having anything to do with the sale. Evidenced by the publication notification of intent to sell property at auction dated XXXX if XXXX for sale in XXXX. How can WF REOPEN a case that they are no longer involved in and legally auction off a property which they are a third party too? Not only did WF auction off my property, they remained the owners of the property being the highest bidder and obtaining title. Multiple documents from Wells Fargo claim this did not happen and that restitution would be given if they found otherwise. Not a single document with the court mentions XXXX XXXX, the owner of the mortgage or Specialized loan servicing whom Wells Fargo transferred the servicing rights to."
3/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"I had unauthorized charges on my debit card. Its an ongoing problem. I do not look at, y online banking often because I know what I spend and you would think I would get notified of these charges. But when I looked at my account on XX/XX/XXXX I saw, y account was drained and there was a ton of unauthorized charges. I spoke with XXXX at Wells Fargo and she helped, XXXX with my claim. She noticed there was an XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to my account with a phone number I did not recognize and I do not have an XXXX. She deactivated it and suggested I file a police report and get my phone checked for viruses or fraud. My dad got me a new phone and we filed a police report. But today my claim was denied. All my money and tax return is gone and XXXX cant even pay rent now. Wells Fargo did not call and ask me any other questions as they went through the claim. These were all unauthorized and I shouldnt be liable for charges I did not make. I ve banked with them since XXXX and am furious that this has happened and that this was there response."
3/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"On XX/XX/2023, at XXXX XXXX I had an appointment that I made earlier in the week with a branch that is approximately one hour away from my home in an ongoing effort to resolve my issue of not being able to facilitate a Fraud Claim with Wells Fargo Bank. The appointment was made with a XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX, CT XXXX, who is aware of the fraud on the account. I made this individual aware of the fraud last year and felt most comfortable meeting with this individual to help me file the claim. I was at this location and the XXXX contacted the XXXX XXXX. on my behalf and at my request, and we spoke with a XXXX XXXX named XXXX. I was at the bank on XX/XX/2023, for over 2 hours submitting this claim with XXXX and providing all the checks, dates, and amounts. The XXXX XXXX XXXX was manually entering each check and stated she would provide a case number once she had completed entering all the information. It was taking much longer than I first anticipated and had another appointment that I had to attend, so the Premier Banker and myself asked XXXX if she could provide me with a case number as I had to leave for an appointment. XXXX had stated to me that she was not finished entering the checks, so I asked her if she could email or send a secure message to my Wells Fargo account with the case number so I could follow up. XXXX stated that she could in fact do that and it would not be a problem. On Wednesday, XXXX XXXX, 2023, I called the Fraud Department at Wells Fargo to follow up on the claim I filed with XXXX and to see why I did not receive the case number as promised. I learned that day that they had no claim for fraud filed. I asked the representative to look again as I was in the bank last week and spent over two hours filing one. Again, I was told no case number or claim was in the system. 
This is the same thing that I have come across since last year when I first found the fraud on the account. It is impossible to file a claim even when I have done so in a branch with a Wells Fargo employee assisting to initiate the claim with me. I do not know why it is so difficult to get a claim filed and why I have to keep complaining about the same issue with the CFPB about Wells Fargo not doing its job and assisting in filing the claim for Fraud. Why is the bank allowed to keep putting it off and not scrutinized when the CFPB is made aware that the same issue is still unresolved with the same banking institution? Wells Fargo has been permitted to have unauthorized individuals write checks, sign them and cash them fraudulently repeatedly with no regard for the law. Why is Wells Fargo not held accountable for this act and the actions that they will not allow the customer to file the fraud claim? What about the Banking Laws? Does Wells Fargo not follow the banking laws that were set forth by our government? Why are they allowed to break the law and get away with it? The following law is a perfect example of the law on fraud. It is a CRIME. 

18 U.S.C. 1344 "" Bank Fraud states that anyone who knowingly executes a scheme in order to defraud a financial institution to obtain money or property from a financial institution using fraudulent representations, will face imprisonment and fines. '' I know that the limitations that the bank is responsible for can change as time goes by and I believe that the bank is stalling so that the amount that they would be responsible for would be less since so much time has been allowed to pass on the bank 's behalf. 
Wells Fargo ignored this crime and permitted it to keep happening against an elderly person, over and over with the same individuals committing the fraud. If the bank tellers kept allowing the crime to go on, maybe the tellers were involved in the fraud. The act only seised, once I was named and appointed Trustee and I took control of the Trust account after the owner of the said Trust account became deceased. The Power of Attorney was allowed to commit fraud on the account as well. I have the bank records which show which account the Power of Attorney was given access to and the Trust is not the account they were given access to. Furthermore, if I had to obtain orders as the Trustee to gain access to the Trust Account why would the bank allow the Power of Attorney to write checks to himself and signed them POA before and after the death of the account holder? I guess I did not need to obtain a Tax Identification number from the Federal Government and I did not need to obtain the court 's permission and be named the Personal Representative and Trustee. There was no need to spend the money in obtaining such official documents if in fact anyone could sign and write checks including the POA. 
I want a claim filed and all individuals involved to be held liable, INCLUDING WELLS FARGO. Their banking practices have failed and the fact that this is now the third complaint that I have had to file and still have no resolution and the individuals who were allowed to commit the fraud are free is ridiculous. They have committed a crime including the bank for allowing the fraud to go on for so long. 
If I can not get assistance from the CFPB, I will seek assistance from the local broadcasting stations/networks. If the CFPB chooses not to help and allows Wells Fargo to get away with fraud then it is my duty and belief that I need to make the Department of Justice aware of such an act committed by the CFPB and Wells Fargo. I have proof of the acts of fraud and yet that is not enough for the CFPB to get Wells Fargo to allow me to make a claim for fraud. I have mentioned before that I have attempted to file the claim in multiple ways and nothing happens. Even the "" fancy '' departments called the Enterprise Complaints Management Office '' does nothing and I was told can not do anything and that I have to file a claim with the Fraud Department. Wells Fargo has literally dragged their feet and bounced me back and forth and this matter goes nowhere. I am not going away or giving up and that is exactly what they want me to do since it has been close to a year and I am still chasing Wells Fargo to file the claim. Wells Fargo must be held liable for not following the banking laws set forth by the United States Federal Government. Allowing a banking institution to neglect the law is the same as the individual ( s ) who committed the act of fraud, to begin with. A call for accountability and justice is needed and someone needs to intervene and take the necessary action to obtain justice for the acts against an elderly woman who is now deceased and was a victim of fraud allowed by Wells Fargo. 
It is difficult to believe that I wasted over 2 hours in a Wells Fargo Branch and no fraud claim was even submitted. What was XXXX doing then? Wells Fargo has been allowed to get away with this action long enough."
3/5/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I went out of town on XX/XX/XXXX and i lost my card before I left town. My pin number was written on my debit card due to the fact of me having hard time remembering my pin numbers as I have a few. After getting back to town on XX/XX/2022, I realized there were unauthorized withdrawals from my checking account and I realized I do not have my card. After contacting wells fargo bank to inform about what happened and filing a dispute, I was provided a claim number # XXXX. After a week or two wells fargo sends the decision of the claim being denied due to the fact that the pin number was used therefore the transactions are valid or were made with my permission. After calling wells fargo back and talking to a few representatives, one of the representatives reopened the claim stating that in the original claim it was stated that I was in possession of my card, which I clearly stated that I was not during the filing of the original claim. Another claim was reopened to further investigate the matter. the new claim number was # XXXX. After their investigation into this matter again, I received a letter stating the same thing that since the pin number was used then the transactions were valid. There were 4 different transactions ( withdrawals ) totaling to {$3900.00}. I have also sent my reservation itinerary to wells fargo claims department showing that I was checked into XXXX XXXX and Casino in XXXX XXXX and I also sent them the receipts of the rides I took using the XXXX XXXX XXXX while I was in XXXX XXXX to get from one hotel to the other. I have exhausted all logical means of trying to reason with Wells Fargo bank but all have been in vein. I state again that I have lost my debit card probably at the gas station when I was pumping gas to get on the road to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, and my pin number was written on my debit card due to my poor memory.

The balance kept changing, the steps l was taking we're not entered into their system, l did what they asked, without understanding any of it.

I've been deprived the right to due process, the right to cure, and l believe these two banks are somehow co conspirators in the violation of my rights to life, liberty, and property. They've committed wire fraud, mail fraud, breach of international contracts, the list goes on. The sale date of my home by them is XX/XX/XXXX.

Unfortunately the thorough investigation only began after the CFPB became involved. After a month long investigation in a XXXX scam, Wells Fargo stated that they could not return our money because it was authorized by the customer. 
Our biggest concerns about this entire situation were that Wells Fargo never warned/informed us as customers about the ongoing incidents with the XXXX scam , that had been taking place throughout the country for over 9 months. They began their XXXX Scam Campaign 2 weeks after we were scammed. 
Our other primary concern is regarding their reading for not returning our money, again stating that it was authorized by this customer. How can something be authorized when it is a scam? I did not authorize someone to steal {$3500.00} from our accounts. I would never authorize someone to take {$3500.00} from my familys savings account. 
The scammer called from a Wells Fargo number. 
When asking Wells Fargo about insurance that covers such fraudulent behaviors and scams, they stated that insurance covers frauds, not scams. 
Wells Fargo stated that they would also follow up with the bank that the money ended up going into to try to get our money back, and we have heard nothing from Wells Fargo since that time. 
We were never warned about the possibility of such a scam prior, though Wells Fargo was well aware of this and they did not protect us from this scam afterward."

I called and spent a total of 3 hours among various WF personnel who kept advising me that I had to go to a branch office to remedy the problem. 
NEVER in all the time I was on the phone trying to find out what was going on with MY MONEY that WF held did anyone say anything other than this is a random hold on your account and you must go to the branch office to speak with a person at the branch When I placed a call to the branch the officer at the branch said I must bring a tablet or a lap top into the branch so that whatever was going on that prevented me from accessing my own money could be dealt with. 
When I protested and said I insisted the branch office person get in contact with a superior and find out how I could access my money and call me back before I spent another 3 hours trying to access my own money and perhaps having to go to the nonsensical trouble of going to the branch office with MY DEVICE the branch person said they would try. 

15 minutes later the branch person called me and said he had spoken to a superior and that person told him that the bill pay is "" down all over the country '' and they expect it up late to day or tomorrow I SPENT 3 HOURS of my time before I was finally told this is a WF problem and had nothing to do with my security which had been the WF position until I became adamant ONLY A BANKING ORGANIZATION THAT IS WITHOUT ANY CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY WOULD BEHAVE IN THIS NEGLIGENT AND RECKLESS MANNER."

3/6/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"Wells Fargo mortgage closing on XX/XX/2015 property with United States Treasury involved. 

Remodification improper fees and Closing mishandled. Add on fees also improper. 

I had this FHA loan for around 15 years and during that time I had 2-3 remodifications recommended by Wells Fargo ( I believe and only remember two. ) This was around the time the market fell in 2008ish.

When I sold this property, Wells Fargo gave the title company the balance owed with two remodifications included to be paid and gave a "" clear to close '' balance which paid off the two remodifications also. We then closed on the property.

Years later I received a letter from the US Treasury saying I owed on a remodification loan that was not paid at closing on the above property to them and I have 30 days to pay {$16000.00} or I will get charged a penalty of {$10000.00}! I thought it may be a scam since they threatened me when I called like a debt collector would, and ignored it until the did charge me the {$10000.00} penalty. They started garnishing my wages and garnishing my tax returns. So I called Wells Fargo and asked them to send all info on the loan. It seemed the accounting was correct, but I really didn't know how to read it. 

I want you to please check the charges on this loan and the remodification fees overcharged as Im not sure if Wells Fargo did not pay them to US Treasury at closing or if US Treasury was paid but did not credit my account. Another scenario is that Wells Fargo added another remodification to my account and forged my name. Otherwise, how would they get a payoff and "" clear to close '' and the Title Company close on the mortgage? 

This has harmed me for years as I was a single mom and XXXXXXXX XXXX and they affected my credit where I could not buy another house and it has affected my and my children 's quality of life. Now I am receiving Social Security and they are garnishing from that check. 

Please help with the charges on the loan and let me know if I really owe this. How could they give a payoff with two modifications paid off and come back years later to tell me US Treasury didn't get paid on another after receiving a payoff from Wells Fargo and "" clear to close '' at closing on this property? 

I appreciate the help so much!"

I could have up to one year of deferment. They assured me that this would not affect my credit, would not be reported to the credit agencies, would not be reported to the V.A. and the deferred payments would be tacked on to the end of the loan. they straight out lied to me. This was immediately reported to all three credit bureaus, also the V.A.

I attempted to hit the escape key to clear screen with no success, all keys were locked. Message on screen stated that I should dial number on screen which was for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I later learned the the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the man posing as a Wells Fargo Fraud Department employee were both imposters. I was told that an employee working for the bank sold customer 's information and my money was in the process of being taken. I was in the process of purchasing a home and needed to hold on to my money. I was told that I needed to move my money into a fictitious account just until the investigation is completed. I was provided with information needed to process a wire transfer through Wells Fargo Bank to a company in New York. The individual ( XXXX XXXX XXXX kept in contact with me, during the ordeal I was scheduled for XXXX XXXX ( entirely too much was going on ).

I was asked if I knew an individual who worked at the branch I visited named XXXX, I told him the I did not know anyone working at the branch. He informed me that XXXX had been arrested, but he may have been working with others. Approximately two or three days later I was contacted by individual again informing me that I needed to process another wire transfer, but that it must be at a different branch and that I should not discuss this matter with anyone because there could be others working with XXXX. I was unable to drive since I had XXXX XXXX, my daughter drove me to another branch, every time I was contacted by XXXX XXXX I was reminded to not discuss the investigation with no one including my family. I visited another branch and processed a wire transfer to a different company in New York, I was told to tell the individual at the desk that the previous wire transfer was reversed because the company was unable to do the work I wanted done. This second wire transfer was for a little less money {$36000.00}, keeping in mind that he assured me that money would be returned as it was previously. Approximately three days later I was contacted by XXXX XXXX again and was informed that the individuals are trying to take my investment money. It was suggested that I contact the investment office and have my investment money deposited into my Wells Fargo account. I became a little suspicious, I called the office regarding my 401K savings, a verification code was sent to my cellular phone after the individual was able to verify that I was the holder of the savings account. I was assured that no one had made any attempts to withdraw any funds from my savings, and would not be able to without physically having my cellular phone. I was furious and called XXXX XXXX and told him that I would not be withdrawing nor transferring another penny. I told him that I needed my money returned immediately so that the purchase of my home can go through, the call was disconnected. I forgot to mention that I was also told that my cellular phone had also been compromised and the number he calls me from is a secured line. I had gone to the store and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone along with minutes for usage. It was late in the day my bank was closed, I obtained the number for Well Fargo Fraud Department using XXXX and filed a claim. The very next day I visited the branch used for the initial wire transfer and explained my situation again. I also visited XXXX XXXX to have my XXXX XXXX laptop scanned and cleaned. I recently received a letter from Wells Fargo Fraud Department informing me that the company DOES NOT WANT TO GIVE MY MONEY and that I should consider my claim CLOSED. This is unacceptable. The money was withdrawn from my 401K and was to be used to purchase my home. Now I don't have the money, but must claim the money as part of my income when I file my taxes. I lost the house I was going to purchase, I am now retired and have no finances and the condominium I am currently living is being sold. I have not received my first retirement interim payment yet.

3/6/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Privacy issues,"I've had a Wells Fargo VISA for years with no issues or problems. On XX/XX/XXXX, I used the card in store at the XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, Pennsylvania between XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to our local XXXX XXXX to get gas between XXXX - XXXXXXXX XXXX When I returned home, I went into the website to do my weekly banking. When I opened up the app on my computer, it revealed that there were XXXX  ( XXXX ) pending transactions from XXXX, and XXXX from XXXX, and all dated XX/XX/XXXX, right after the XXXXXXXX XXXX charge. I called Wells Fargo immediately. The call lasted over 9 minutes. The Wells Fargo representative could not advise me on why there were so many charge attempts but asked if I wanted to close the account to avoid future attempts. I said yes. The card I had was no longer useful. 

I took XXXX ( XXXX ) weeks before I received the new card on XX/XX/XXXX. I activated it, but did not used it right away. When I went to do my banking on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I found a {$55.00} charge from XXXXXXXX XXXX for an annual membership that was not due to renew until XX/XX/XXXX ( they charged me a full year 's membership for only XXXX months ( different problem ). 

I called XXXX XXXX because I was upset seeing my new credit card ( activated XXXX days before this charge ) sitting on their website. I have several accounts that require a monthly payment ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. ) and none of them have automatic payments set up, so I know I did not set this up automatically either. I also did not update my credit card information from XXXX because I was deciding whether it was worth renewing it at {$55.00} when I paid {$30.00} last year, and I thought I had a month to make that decision. 

When I spoke to the representative at XXXXXXXX XXXX, they advised me that my credit card company, Wells Fargo, gave them the new card information ( all XXXX digits, expiration date and the CCV code ). I can't even describe the feelings that came over me. A brand-new credit card, XXXX days old in activation, and it was just handed over to a company without my knowledge or permission, then they allowed the charge to go through. 

I had the charge reversed, and then called Wells Fargo, which has been a nightmare to deal with on a higher level than the fraud of the card. 

They said it was a "" convenience '' procedure to update revolving charges so that the customer would not have to do it. I'm pretty sure you have to get permission from the actual cardholder to do something like that, but the XXXX representatives I spoke to said we don't have to get permission, we just do it. The second one asked if I wanted to talk to a customer advocate. I agreed. Big mistake. 

To date, the only phone call I received from Wells Fargo was a missed call because the number was not "" verified ''. When I XXXX  the number it showed Wells Fargo. I called them back, and spent over XXXX minutes, XXXX seconds re-explaining the problem. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In the meantime, I had filed a complaint with the XXXX  Attorney General 's Office for assistance. They have closed the case because Wells Fargo has decided not to mediate the case. 

I received a letter from Wells Fargo, dated XX/XX/XXXX. These are the "" troubling '' words that they wrote : Wells Fargo takes its responsibility to safeguard the funds of our customers very seriously, and we take many measures to prevent fraudulent and unauthorized activity. Our records indicate that a lost or stolen transfer was initiated on the account ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. A lost or stolen transfer is used in situations where the possibility of fraud exists. 

This was NOT taken seriously. I called Wells Fargo. I noticed the transactions. I told them what was occurring. 

Next problem : When credit cards are closed, if you have not reached out to the merchant that the subscriptions on your card to let them know that they have to be cancelled, the new account will be charged. Our Fraud Department would not have give the merchant the new account number over the phone as that is not anything they are able to do. Based on your account records, we do not show where the merchant called in nor did we provide them with the full account number. 

If Wells Fargo did not provide them with the new card information, how did they get it? Is this standard procedure? If it is, where is the authorization from me to give out that new information? 

It is XXXX. You would think that financial institutions would try to assist consumers with all of the fraud that occurs on a daily basis. If they didn't give it out, I would like to know who did and where is the authorization from me to do so."

They asked that I send more information and I did but they did not respond and then said that because I didnt send it they would not get my money. This all started XX/XX/XXXX of this year and they have done nothing to help me. I asked them to freeze my account and stop checks from being deposited while they were pending but they still let it all go through. When I call to give more information they dont answer or allow me to so I send them emails and they do not respond. There were checks deposited to my accounts that I did not deposit. Two checks of {$1500.00} and when I asked to stop them they did nothing and let them go through. Then when I was getting threatening messages to hurt me and my family if I didnt return the money so I did my best to return it but the checks bounced so now they blame it all on me. I sent that money back because of their negligence to help me when I needed it and now they are not helping me. They told me to just change my phone number and that was it. I also filed a police report and havent heard back since.
3/6/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"XX/XX/23 I received an email from "" XXXX XXXX '' from a company called "" XXXX '' claiming I was accepted for an interview for a remote data analyst position. After several interviews only via email, I was given the job and given instructions on how to purchase "" equipment '' for the remote position including a new desktop, printer, etc. needed for the position. I made several attempts to contact the company, research the website and company on XXXX, credit buraus etc. 

XX/XX/23 I received an offer letter via email and signed it. I then received a check from the company and instructed to deposit the check into my account via mobile deposit. The check was not under the name "" XXXX '' and was named "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' however was told "" it is a company-certified check from our company or one of our Project consortium partners. '' I was emailed the check in the amount of {$4900.00}, printed the check out and mobile deposited the check into my Wells Fargo Banks account. 

XX/XX/23 I was in contact with 2 new email accounts, "" XXXX XXXX  '' XXXX, and "" XXXX XXXX '' XXXX, who was named "" XXXX XXXX ''. XXXX Finances emailed me the check and I uploaded to my Wells Fargo checking account as mentioned above. "" XXXX XXXX '' emailed me stating that once my funds from the mobile deposit, that I would be using their vendor to purchase the equipment instead of me purchasing on my own. XXXX XXXX sent me an invoice amount of {$4600.00} and provide instructions on wire transferring this amount from my checking account to his checking account. Details were : Account name : XXXX XXXX Bank name : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX : XXXX Routing number : XXXX Bank address : XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX New York, NY XXXX Grand Total : {$4600.00} Memo/Payment Description : Your full name with Invoice # XXXX I was to send screenshots of completion of transfer since it took a day to process this. The transfer was processed XX/XX/23. 

XX/XX/23 I received a text message from "" XXXX XXXX from phone number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX stating he was from "" XXXX XXXX  '' asking me about confirmation of the transfer to that XXXX XXXX  account that was provided above. I confirmed and continued messaging this number. XXXX stated that he would be able to potentially drop them off some time in the day. After I sent the amount, I never received anymore correspondence from all 3 parties. 

On the same day, I notice my account was under {$3100.00} in my checking account and realized that the original check of {$4900.00} bounced and was in the process of being returned. I was also recently paid that day and should not have been over-drafted. 

I immediately called Well Fargo Bank fraud and claims department to discuss the issues and file a claim. I was told by an XXXX on Wells Fargo that I would receive my funds back. 

XXXX After calling back and forth the claims department regarding the status of my claim and results, I was not able to be told if I would receive my funds sent back. Per Wells Fargo, I should have had this issues resolved within 10-business days, as well as provided a temporary credit towards my account until the case is resolved. I did not receive temporary funds whatsoever. 

XX/XX/23 I received a letter today stating that my claim I filed was closed and that I would not receive the funds I sent due to me "" authorizing '' the wire transfer, even though I was a victim of fraud/scam. Wells Fargo Bank 's claim department told me that I would not be able to re-open the case and that it was closed, and that I would have to pay back the funds that I am now over-drafted in the amount of - {$3100.00}. I do not get paid a wage that is possible for me to pay this amount back and maintain my basic needs. 

I am writing to see if there is anything I can to do by lodging this complaint against Wells Fargo for their terrible service and inability to help me in this financially struggle. I will attach any evidence I can to this case.

I rented a car from XXXX rent a car from XXXX The rent was {$750.00}, rental agreement XXXX. I used my Wells Fargo Credit card, and I had like {$2000.00} available credit limit on my card. Before the rental was closed, Wells Fargo decreased my credit limit from {$4500.00} to {$2500.00}, so when the rental agreement was closed I went with {$600.00} over my credit limit. Wells Fargo also demands to pay in full the {$600.00} over my credit limit. This puts me in financial burden and hurts my credit score. 
I called Wells Fargo Bank and tried to solve the situation without success. I was told, nothing they can do. 
When acting so, Wells Fargo should take in consideration outstanding preauthorized charges, so those outstanding charges wont bring my account over limit.

3/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XXXX XXXX, 2023 I deposited a cashiers check from a legitimate credit union into my Wells Fargo checking account. I had closed a XXXX XXXX with the credit union a few days earlier. The check amount was {$96000.00} and all of that amount was to be included in available balance the next day, which was a Friday, and I checked and it was indeed included in my available balance the next day. Confirming that, I proceeded to initiate a transfer of {$25000.00} to a money market account at XXXX Bank. HOWEVER, over the weekend, someone at Wells Fargo essentially removed the {$96000.00} from my available balance, without any notice to me, which led to an alarming email from Wells Fargo the following Monday morning ( today ) informing me that my balance was currently at - {$23000.00}, so I was hugely overdrawn because of the {$25000.00} transfer to XXXX. And I was unable to cancel that transfer request. I promptly went to a Wells Fargo branch and after a few hours got a call from the manager telling me that the money was back in my account, so I suppose all is well now, but this entire experience has shaken my confidence in our banking system. How can a bank simply remove a large portion of available balance like this without giving any notice to the consumer/customer?"
3/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo deposited {$960.00} into my checking account. Next to the deposited amount was this explanation ; DEP ADJ-LIST OF CHECKS NOT INCLUDED I immediately called Wells Fargo and asked what that deposit was for, what checks they were referring to and when the original error took place. They could not answer even one of my questions but assured me that the money was mine. I FLAT OUT told them they had made a mistake and I was sure the money did not belong to me as I keep a pretty close eye on my accounts. They put me on hold for a long, long wait while they reached out to their "" Research Department ''. They finally returned and told me that again, they couldn't give me the specifics of the mistake but, that the money belonged to me and that was that. I got off the phone and told my Husband "" they are crazy... it's not our money. '' A week later I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo. The letter, dated XXXX stated that they had received a deposit made to my account in the amount of {$120.00} but, the amount they received was {$1000.00} therefore they credited me {$960.00}. On the back of the letter was a photo copy of my check # XXXX, made out to XXXX ( our Gardner ), which appeared uncashed in the amount of {$120.00}. NONE of it made sense to me but, I wasn't willing to call them again and waste 45 minutes of my time to again hang up without clear answers so I left it alone. I didn't hear another word about it. In late XXXX I gathered all of our XXXX information banking and otherwise to prepare for tax season. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo removed {$960.00} from our account with this explanation ; Transaction correction - Reverse transaction of {$960.00} posted to account in error on XX/XX/XXXX - REF # XXXX They also withdrew {$120.00} from check # XXXX dated XXXX. The same check they copied on the back of the XXXX letter I mentioned above. 
Removing this money so late in the month WITHOUT notice caused my account to overdraft which caused them to pull money out of my savings account in order to cover their withdrawal. Then I had to pull more money out of my savings account to cover two automatic payments both dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
I do not understand how it's okay for Wells Fargo to just "" reach '' into my account ( s ) and deposit money without a full and detailed explanation LET ALONE "" reach '' back in to remove funds ... {$960.00} which is a lot of funds to me. 
How is it okay that they can't balance their own accounts? 
They are a bank ... shouldn't they be able to balance better than this? 
Shouldn't they be able to show me a money trail so it makes sense where my error was? 
How is it okay for them to not do a full audit on this situation when I called to tell them the money wasn't ours last year? Let alone TEN MONTHS LATER! 
They called me this morning because I called on the XXXX and put in another complaint and THEY STILL CAN NOT GIVE ME A MONEY TRAIL WHICH I CAN FOLLOW TO MAKE SENSE OF ANY OF THIS! I think that is so wrong. I believe I am entitled to a full and complete explanation with a money trail that is easy to follow and they refuse to give me one. I asked to meet with a Bank Manager near me to get answers and XXXX XXXX ( the person who called me today ) told me a bank manager couldn't tell me how this happened either. 
Please help me. I am so frustrated and Wells Fargo just talks me in circles until I am so tired and upset I can't see straight. 

The person I heard from today is XXXX XXXX Senior Escalation Representative with Wells Fargo Ent. Complaint & Remediation XXXX She gave me no helpful or useful information."
3/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"During the 2021 timeframe when the SBA was issuing {$2000.00} loans, Wells Fargo froze my checking account and I was unable to receive my loan. 

They stated that my account was frozen because they did not have a copy of my social security card on file however, it was in fact used to open my account. 

So, I provided them with another copy of my social security card and the freeze was lifted. A week or so later, another freeze was placed on my account for the same reason. So once again I provided a copy of my ssn card. 

This ordeal caused Wells Fargo to return my {$2000.00} check back to SBA. 

I informed Wells Fargo about this on several occasions however they never rectified the problem."

I still to this day call them about it because with my check going missing and the over draft fees it ended up being about {$1000.00} gone. I was without a paycheck for over a month having to pay back the fees that they charged me. I contacted my work as well which confirmed my check was deposited to the same bank account that it was always deposited in for months.

While I was in the bank taking care of my own banking business. I had not seen her in the bank at the beginning when I started opening my new checking account. She was purposely having the bank employees tell her when I was going to be at the bank. The last day i was finishing up setting my new account open. There she was when I entered the bank. Then the police showed up after I starting my banking business. The banker can verify I wasn't harassing XXXX XXXX. Wells fargo management or XXXX XXXX didn't investigate the security footage to show when XXXX XXXX arrived at the bank prior to me arrival. But the police didn't do anything because they had a confused look at me like what's going on here. But it made XXXX XXXX furious so she whined to XXXX XXXX then my account was closed a few days after that when I tried to make a purchase and I was embarrassed. This was why my first account was closed so she could set me up. She was messing in my account to disable my online access so they could pretend to open me a new checking account. To have the police arrest me for coming around her. The XXXX XXXX  were dropped against me. There was no XXXX XXXX telling me to stay away from XXXX or XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX sent me a hostile letter threatening. 

my civl rights that, any business I had with wells fargo was to be conducted over the phone or e-mail and that I wasn't allowed to enter any wells fargo bank and he threaten that the police would be called on me. It was XXXX XXXX coming around me intentionally to get me banned from wells fargo. There was no investigation or anything. She was just automatically believed. her side without looking at the security footage. 

I did not harass XXXX XXXX and it can be verified by the bank cameras and the banker i was working with. I had no idea XXXX XXXX was even at the back. This was a dirty criminal thing she and those female bankers even the female branch manager was involed in this crooked set up to get me. XXXX XXXX took her harassing me as a neighbor and slandered me at wells fargo causing me to lose my checking account or any other type of loan with wells fargo or a car loan. 

Then management told me that they don't handle domestic disputes. Well, they closed my account after she lied about me. So that is a domestic dispute. So don't tell me that lie! XXXX XXXX brought the domestic dispute in wells fargo to get other employees to hate me and be against me. 

The police didn't escort me out of wells fargo. Because I wasn't harassing her the banks cameras will also see where she went. It makes me so angry and outraged that I was treated this way. 

A lawyer did tell me i can receive thousands from the bank for how unfair they did me. 
Wells fargo wasn't exercising its right to close my account until XXXX XXXX falsely accused me of harassing her.. She harassed me as a neighbor but lied saying i was harassing her and telling me. 

Why don't I take my mentally XXXX son back to my home? He received social security and he put it on the application when he had a checking account there. This is how she could only know that to call him such a hate slur like that. There was no misunderstanding about that. Then she went on to tell me how poor I was and looked at all the vehicles they had. 

XXXX XXXX was telling her friends and family about my son. His banking information is private and was breached because of XXXX XXXX & wells fargo refuses to hold her accountable. But i was punished by wells fargo because she lied saying i was harassing her at the bank. 

When she purposely put herself at the bank. When I had no idea she was at the bank. I am owed compensation because of what she did. She brought this issue in wells fargo to spread these horrible lies about me. But the management at wells fargo believed her side."

On XXXX : A provisional credit for both fraudulent charges was given by Wells Fargo while the case is investigated. 

On XXXX : The investigation by Wells Fargo concluded. The {$60.00} charge from XXXX was deemed as fraud and reversed. However the fraud case for the larger {$2500.00} charge from XXXX was denied by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo stated the case was denied because my address was used for the transaction thus I authorized the transaction or authorized another person to perform the transaction. 

On XXXX : The provisional credit for the {$2500.00} charge by XXXX was reversed. I called the Wells Fargo Debit Card Fraud Department who enforced the case denial despite my protest in not authorizing the debit card transaction. 

On XXXX : After the denial letter was received, I visited a Wells Fargo branch and spoke with the banker there. A complaint was filed for the case denial. 

On XXXX : A representative from Wells Fargo 's escalation department called me and reiterated the claim was denied.

They only decided this after I hired this company to work with them to refund all of the overdraft fees and they were expecting Wells Fargo to work with them and once they closed the account there was nothing else the company could do. I have seen many lawsuits against Wells Fargo for this exact same reason and I think I deserve to have those fees dropped and a check from Wells Fargo to open up a new bank account that I can trust."

For example, if you spend {$200.00} in a cycle and have earned XXXX  points, that information does not appear on the statement. You have to track it yourself, which makes it easy for Wells Fargo to mistakenly ( or purposely ) fail to issue the correct number of points and stamps.

My employer paid early, usually it will not be paid until the Friday. It clearly showed ony account, the entire day of XXXX XXXX, it remained there until the evening of XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore that deposit should have taken care of the ACH request of XXXX it did not, instead Wells Fargo revoked the funds claiming that the employer did not want it posted til Friday which they do not have any legal right to speak tou employer for any reason, the claim is false. They revoked my pay until XX/XX/2023 and by the they had already returned the ACH charge without funding even though the funds were available on XX/XX/XXXX. They not only stole funds from me for XXXX hours but they refused to honor the "" Extra Day Grace Period, '' XXXX g that it's up to the system to decide payment or not, '' or that policy only applies to over drafts, to which this was a temporary overdrafts. Not only has Wells Fargo committed fraud but they have decide to be choosy on who gets the "" Extra Day Grace Period '' even though there are no specifics and it is offered to everyone who has a Wells Fargo account. 
I keep getting the same excuses "" were still processing the complaint, '' or "" We can't do anything about it. '' Wells Fargo refuses to honor their policies and has committed fraud to which they refuse to rectify unless they are taken to Federal court."

My mother died in 2010 and my first thought was that this is some sort of scam or phishing expedition. I called them back to see how far they would take it. Also, there was a remote possibility that it could be legitimate. XXXX at XXXX XXXX claimed that my deceased mother had a savings account at Wells Fargo containing approximately {$19000.00} that had apparently been missed by probate 13 years prior. Their "" fee '' would be 10 % of the amount returned by Wells Fargo. I had a meeting with the local Wells Fargo branch manager, and she was absolutely useless. She wouldn't tell me whether her employer uses companies like XXXX XXXX for the purpose stated. Side note : They wouldn't need to because both my parents have lived at the same address for the last 60 years and are easy to locate. My father, who is XXXX and still very much alive, still lives there. The branch manager wouldn't say even if my mother was in their system or if an account existed. She hid behind the fact that I didn't have the requisite documentation of probate. Next, my XXXXXXXX XXXX father went down to the local Well Fargo branch in Florida with ALL THE REQUISITE DOCUMENTATION to establish the facts. Wells Fargo treated him exactly the way they handled me. They wouldn't say anything helpful. Today, my father doesn't know whether or not it's a scam or not, because Wells Fargo has been totally uncooperative in the matter. Doesn't the bank have a fiduciary duty to provide more information, instead of stonewalling the customer. Plus, if it is a scam, it needs to be reported to the proper authorities as soon as possible."

But, their app is not showing the correct balance. They are also still referencing my ex-husband 's bankruptcy in the letters as well.

I would like to add that I was forced to go to the branch because no one at that location can be bothered to answer the phone. I called several times before having to drive there. I also left a message on XXXX XXXX 's voicemail and he has not responded. 

I called Wells Fargo customer service to file a complaint since no one at the XXXX XXXX branch seems to care about the issue.

She was able to cancel it and start a complaint in my behalf - case number, XXXX.

This is not the case and this is a MAJOR VIOLATION! 


Usc 1635 : states that a consumer has a right to rescind the contract if certain guidelines aren't met. The creditor is to legally inform a consumer of their right to rescind and they have 3 business days. If the consumer is never notified, they have 3 years.

3/7/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,My taxes were deposited and available to my account per text message. On XX/XX/2023 I transferred money from a checking to a savings account that same day. The next day and the following days more transfers and some payments made to cash app. Majority of my transactions were transfers from my savings to my checking account with the biggest paymentbto vash app being {$1200.00} when I woke up on the XXXX of XXXX My my account was negative {$1200.00} when I called the bank They advised me that my account was negative on the XXXX in the amount of {$5500.00} because of a transfer from my checkingbto my savinging she said the funds were available but not posted at the time I transferred. My account went negative based on transfers from my savings to my checking or from my checking to my savings. However I know like with right now if my account is negative it's not gon na allow me to continue transferring money from one account to the other when I talk to the representative at Wells Fargo she advised me that my account was negative because of the way Wells Fargo processes the transfers and deposits. She told me that my account was negative over {$5000.00} after a {$4500.00} transfer and then I got a deposit of {$6600.00} which doesn't make any sense because I got a text message from them when the {$6600.00} deposit was made also I didn't have XXXX to transfer before I got that text. This is fraud there is no way that I should owe {$1200.00} based off of transfers. That I made from XXXX account to another when the backs will not allow you to transfer money from XXXX account to the other that is not available. I watched the money I transfered be removed from the balance as I make the transactions so I'm unsure how this money is owed when the money i spend shows u avaliable the moment I spend it.

3/7/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"I had a car loan with Well Fargo and the interest rate was higher than I noticed even having a great credit score i was paying {$250.00} monthly. when the car was bought off the lot, I believe it was {$13000.00} but when it was all said and done, I feel like I paid way too much. I put {$2500.00} down and still took a while to pay down the interest."
3/8/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to Wells Fargo Bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IA XXXX ). I took out {$6000.00} in cash, each banknote was {$20.00} one, and went to the counter to make a deposit. After the teller took the money, she left the counter and went to a place 45 meters away. After the money counter rang, she remained there and told me loudly that it was only {$5600.00}. I replied loudly : Impossible. She said she would check again. I heard the money counter working again. She told me loudly again : oh, it's {$5700.00}. Then, she came over and handed me a counting receipt showing {$1700.00}. 
When I deposit cash in the bank, the amount is always in thousands, and I count repeatedly to make sure the amount is correct. So I don't think it's possible that the money is less by {$300.00}. But when she said that, I was confused at the time. I was particularly concerned that the deposit was not in thousands, so I took out six {$50.00} banknotes from my bag and handed them to her, making a {$6000.00} deposit. 
I left the bank and went home, and saw that my {$3000.00} cash were {$300.00} short. I seemed to wake up from a dream. 
After about ten minutes, I was a little unwilling to accept it. So I went to the bank again and asked her to count the XXXX dollars. She took out two bundles of {$2000.00} dollars and went to the money counter again. However, I was not sure that those two bundles were my {$4000.00}. She said that the money was exactly {$4000.00}. She still did not give me the counting receipt. 

1. How is it possible that the error of the money counter was exactly in hundreds, considering the cash was all {$20.00} banknotes?

2. The deposit receipt shows loose currency {$100.00}. However, I just deposited {$20.00} and {$50.00} banknotes. Why?

3. Every time I deposit money with other tellers, the amount is correct. However, in my memory, this teller handled my deposits about six times, and at least three times she said that my money was less than what I said, and the discrepancy was getting bigger and bigger. The first issue happened in around XXXX. I can't remember the exact details, but it seems that I deposited {$3000.00}, and she said the money was {$80.00} short. At the second time, I don't remember how much I deposited. I just remember that she told me softly through the glass that the money was {$160.00} short. I didn't believe it. She took the money back to the money counter to count again, and then came over again and told me that it was still {$160.00} short. 
4. The teller 's operation does not conform to the bank 's procedures. I only found out last year that after counting the banknotes, the machine should produce a small note showing the number of banknotes and the amount of money. However, the first two times the teller just told me that I was short of money, but never gave me the note. Later, another teller handled my deposit and gave me such a note. Until then I realized I should have got such notes. 

I called the manager  that day and told him what had happened. The manager said that he would report it to the superior and told me he would call me the next day. On XX/XX/XXXX I didn't receive his call. So I called him at XXXX XXXX. I asked him how my problem would be solved. He said he was busy and would call me later. I waited until XXXX XXXX, and he still didn't contact me. So I called again, and told him what had happened again. He said that he would check all the deposits in my bank account, and the higher authorities would contact me. I urged him to solve it as soon as possible, but he said he couldn't decide and asked me to wait patiently. 
I waited until XX/XX/XXXX and received a letter from the bank. The letter said : we need more time to respond to your concern. We'll follow up with you by XX/XX/XXXX. If we need more time, we'll let you know. From then on I have not heard anything from the bank. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the CFPB to explain the situation. After receiving a letter from CFPB, I went to the CFPB website to complain. 
The evidence is attached. 
1. The deposit receipt 2. The record in my cell phone, showing I called the XXXX on XXXX. His number is XXXX. 
3. The record in my cell phone, showing I called the manager on XXXX for the first time. His number is XXXX.

3/8/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"My parents have passed, and I am the Executor of their Estate. They were living in Arizona, unbeknownst to me as their grandson moved them without advising anyone. My parents did not have a cell phone to contact me. Not until over a year later did my father contact me saying they were being abused by the grandson and they needed help. I arranged my home in California to accommodate them, and drove to Arizona to bring them to my home to live. 
I discovered my mother had a loan with Wells Fargo Bank No. WF # XXXX- XXXX XXXX. Other parties that may have been involved were her grandson XXXX XXXX and his wife XXXX XXXX. Neither had any authority over my parents, as my parents had a trust showing the named people to be able to speak on their behalf, which was not either of them. 
My mother had XXXX and XXXX diseases, wheel-chair bound and deemed incompetent. She could not sign any legal document, but the grandson and his wife took advantage of her XXXX. My father was completely competent and a witness. 

The XXXX told my parents they had to sign a rental agreement and brought both of them to an office with one person to sign the rental agreement. They had my father sign one document and quickly escorted him out of the room. Wells Fargo had my incompetent mother sign many documents ( found on-line ) for a loan. Of course, my mother had no idea what occurred and my father was not allowed to be in the room to see his wife sign various documents. 
In the meantime, my father contacted me to say they had no food or medications and they needed help because my mother continued to fall and hurt herself. The XXXX dumped them in a rental to fend for themselves. Also discovered was XXXX XXXX stole my parents narcotic medication each month and replaced it with Ativan. The police were involved and charged XXXX XXXX with a felony for narcotic theft. I have placed various adult protective reports in Arizona, which the department failed to investigate. 
Once I discovered this fraudulent loan, I asked my parents to write out what occurred on the day of the signing. I contacted a notary in Arizona to notarize these hand-written documents. When I arrived in Arizona to move them in with me in California, I asked them again to handwrite what occurred on the day of signing. I had these documents notarized. Knowing what a notary is and that they request verification of signatures, they confirmed that no one asked for their identification at the signing of the rental agreement. Wells Fargo does not want these notarized statements, which will implicate they authored a fraudulent loan. 
There is a notary signature on the documents. As a prior notary myself, I contacted the XXXX XXXX to discover the person was not registered, and if they retired, they had to relinquish their notary book, which they did not. 
I wrote many letters to Wells Fargo about this fraudulent loan. I have been in contact with the directors who refuse to reply to me. 
Wells Fargo was well aware at this signing that the loan was fraudulent, there was no notary and my mother was incompetent and could not sign any document. The loan mysteriously was paid off. 
Yesterday, I contacted XXXX XXXX, Director of CDPH who wrote me an e-mail suggesting that I file a claim with CDPH, which is what I am doing. 
I am happy to provide any documentation requested to prove any statement made, and that my mothers loan was fraudulent. Of note, I am a retired fraud investigator to understand what documents are necessary in an investigation.

I was also working with a company called XXXX XXXX to try and get a loan modification. I sent in all required documents. I was involved in a car accident and have excessive medical bills because of the accident."
3/8/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Under FOIA I respectfully demand Wells Fargo produce FHA loan modification denial letter. I am in contact with FHA. It was more monetarily beneficial for Wells Fargo to approve a short sale instead of what I and my family was entitled. The U.S. Government gave Wells Fargo bail out HAMP money to keep homeowners in their home. Instead Wells Fargo used HAMP money to enriched itself, its shareholders and Wells Fargo 's employees who worked against Wells clients in order to get compensatory bonus for each loan modification it denied and for every short sale it approved. I have always insisted upon LOAN MODIFICATION since 2012. Under FOIA - produce FHA denial letter. According to truth challenged XXXX XXXX, "" Wells Fargo will have a mediation - so you need to wait until Wells Fargo contact you. '' Hence, I do not want any further phone communication on a recorded line from any Wells Fargo employee because they speak alternative truth."

On the week prior to XXXX, I mailed the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ to pay my credit card balance, but XXXX XXXX never received the payment. On XX/XX/, I went to my local Wells Fargo XXXX in XXXX, NC to stop the payment on the check thinking that the check was lost in the mail. XXXX "" XXXX XXXX '' was assisting me with the process. XXXX saw that the check was negotiated to someone named "" XXXX XXXX '' I showed him a copy of the original check that it was payable to "" XXXX XXXX '' We decided to open a fraud investigation. Wells Fargo fraud handling team 's opened a case ( XXXX ) Wells Fargo rep and banker told me that the case will be resolved within 30 business days, and I will receive my funds within 10 business days. I wanted to report the fraud to law enforcement. On XX/XX/, I called the fraud claims center to collect information about where the check was negotiated in order to notify the proper law enforcement agency. The rep I spoke with did not have any information. However, they mentioned that the investigator handling my case should. I requested to speak with the investigator and was told that the investigator will call me at my phone number. On XX/XX/, I called back for updates on the claim as I had not received any phone call. The rep said that the investigator attempted to contact me with no success. I mentioned that I never received any phone call or voicemail. The rep put in another request for the investigator to call me back. the 10 days mark passed by, and I did not receive my funds back, nor did I get any updates or phone call. On XX/XX/, I called the claims center again and insisted on speaking with the investigator. The rep said that I should fill out the affidavit and send it to Wells Fargo. I mentioned that I never received any paperwork and that I still had not received any phone call from the investigator. The rep said that the investigator attempted to contact me a few times even though there was never any voicemail or messages received. I went to my local branch and expressed my frustration. The banker "" XXXX XXXX '' helped me get the affidavit form by email. I also filed a complaint with Wells Fargo Executive team about how my case was handled with complete negligence and lack of transparency. Wells Fargo Executive team opened a case XXXX. After investigating the fraud case, I finally got the response that the check was negotiated at a XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I had to wait up to 120 days for a response from that bank. I insisted that I wanted to know where the altered check was negotiated, so I could notify law enforcement in that jurisdiction. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo did not want to find out nor give me any information on that. I insisted that it is crucial to file a report with law enforcement about the crime that was committed to prevent other customers from having the same situation. Wells Fargo did not seem to care for their customers, and their lack of competence and transparency is the reason why I have not received my funds back."

I do not even know how to XXXX and I do not know any of the people that received the money. 

When I contacted Wells Fargo several times they told me it was nothing they could do. One teller called me from the bank on her personal phone and threaten me saying that since I had said I would get a attorney I had threaten her, and she went on to say I would never get my money back. 

It was not until I spoke with my XXXX XXXX XXXX that some listen to me and I start the process to getting my money back with their aide."

I contacted the card and informed I did not make those purchases. I was told they would send a new credit card, it would take between 5 to 7 business days for the new card. on XX/XX/2023 I received another text message, two new additional charges with the last 4 digits of the a card number that I don't recognize.

Called the credit card again informed that I still don't have a new card and this "" new card '' was never activated and questioned how can a inactive card can be charged. I was informed by their fraud department that these were recurring charges. I do not have recurring charges on the old card and still didn't activate the new card. Same call, the fraud department then informed this was a charge the fraudsters tried to place on the old card and somehow associated with the new one. Again this "" new card '' which I don't even have the number was never activated. I can't confirmed if a new card account was opened or if this is the replacement card. Checking the account online still asks me to activate the new card never received. Again a this new card supposedly was cancelled and again a new card will be issued. This is a recurring fraud happening where the information is being passed to the fraudsters with the new number before the card holder gets the card. I asked several times how this can be prevented and was informed the "" issued '' was taken care since the cards gets cancelled. I also questioned how can a a card have a charge if it was not activated if this is in fact the replacement card."

Once I made the apyment, the foreclosed the following day. The 2nd property I own was modified after over a year of attempts and another large pmt made. Wells Fargo charged inspection fees, attorney fees and other costs which was what caused me to fall so far behind and I should be part of the recent lawsuit to reimburse consumers due to this."
3/8/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"XXXX XXXX and the Wells Fargo Executive team are not serious about treating their customers ethically. 

Since XXXX Wells Fargo has assessed me approx {$5700.00} in Overdraft fees ( please note this amount is AFTER all reversals ). Overdraft fees are a predatory practice to exploit the poor and break their Deposit Account Agreements. 

Please note the following : - While attempting to overcome a season of hardship in XXXX, Wells Fargo charged me {$2600.00} AND illegally repossessed my vehicle! 

- In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo held a {$2000.00} check I deposited for TWO WEEKS! 

- The check was from one of the Largest health insurance providers in my state. 

- The check was less than {$5500.00} - I've NEVER had a check deposited that has returned unpaid - I've had no overdraft fees since XX/XX/XXXX - Wells Fargo did not mention an emergency or failure of communications equipment."
3/8/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"On XX/XX/2023 I went to the Wells Fargo branch location at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, NC to deposit my payroll check. I utilized the drive through teller window to deposit my payroll check in the amount of {$870.00} On my deposit slip, I instructed the teller to deposit the full amount of the check into my Savings Account # XXXX, with {$200.00} of the check amount issued to me in cash as a withdrawal. The teller provided me with 10 bills worth {$20.00} each. Later, I received a notification that my check had been returned as unpaid due to a tear at the bottom of the check where the account and routing numbers are located. Due to this returned check, my account was debited {$870.00}. However, my account should have only been debited that entire amount if I had actually withdrawn the entire amount of the check in cash. I did not. My balance should have been brought down to {$340.00} since my account was at {$530.00} at the time of the deposit and I only withdrew {$200.00} of the returned check amount in cash. Instead, I have been told that my account has a negative balance because Wells Fargo claims that they issued me the entire check amount of {$870.00} as a cash withdrawal. 

Wells Fargo has performed an initial investigation of this matter under claim number XXXX and determined that they do not owe me any money because I received a new check from my employer for the returned check amount. However, Wells Fargo has incorrectly claimed that I withdrew the full check amount in cash on that day and now claims that I owe them that amount. That is false. I only withdrew {$200.00} of the {$870.00} check and attempted to deposit the remainder. Wells Fargo has claimed that there is no video footage of this matter and that I withdrew the entire amount of the check in cash. I respectfully do not believe that to be the case. I request that this matter be reviewed. You will find that the teller never handed me {$870.00}. She only provided me with {$200.00}. I am simply asking for my account to be properly debited for the actual withdrawal that I made of {$200.00} which would bring my account balance to {$340.00}, which accurately represents the {$200.00} debit from the original amount of {$540.00}. The deposit slip presented to the teller that day confirmed that the full check was deposited to the bank, except for {$200.00} that was provided to me as a cash withdrawal. Thank you for looking into this matter."
3/8/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"To follow up with further documentation, as I relayed I put my home up for sale, I was not at that time behind on a payment! I right away had a cash buyer, Wells Fargo drug their feet on this sale, said that HUD wouldnt let me sell. This was not true. I even spoke with HUD they said I should be fine to sell.I again spoke with Wells Fargo & the lady said I should be fine. So when my realtor put through the work they said I had a problem with my loan. They fabricated this problem. All this took weeks & I thought I was just waiting to close, then because of their dragging their feet Im now 1 payment behind they new I had a cash buyer so they caused my home not to sell so they could sell to my cash buyer & they made the profit. 
Im am sick from being treated like I didnt speak to both parties say I should be able to sell. They fabricated an inner issue to cause be to have to Short Sale. I was absolutely a victim in their illogical activity. Im discussing this with a layer this time. I suggest this be looked into further. There should even be recorded messages with my being told I could sale as well as documentation with HUD that if I had a cash buyer I could sell. 
Wells Fargo needs to finally be stopped with these illegal actions against innocent people, in my case I was targeted as a single women & easy to bury illegal practices. I know what I was told. When I talked to these people it always said our conversation s were being recorded, so why arent those checked. I was forced into signing paperwork acting as though they were reconstructing my loan not stealing my escrow, my cash buyer waited patiently through this entire process & Wells Fargo saw this & took advantage of this with illegal Short Sell transactions."

The check posted on XXXX, that's when I reported Fraud to Wells Fargo on XXXX. I completed an Affidavit of check fraud as requested by Wells Fargo. An Investigation was started by Wells Fargo check Fraud Division and they found out that and account holder with XXXX XXXX  altered the check and put XXXX as the pay to the order. XXXX knows who the account holder info and at the request of Wells Fargo and XXXX will not respond after repeated requests since XXXX. There is a XXXX account number on the check so XXXX knows who has perpetrated the fraud. I keep calling the Fraud division for Wells Fargo for 5 months and no action or resolve as of this complaint. Wells Fargo has mishandles these fund and are responsible."
3/9/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Check cashing service,Problem with customer service,None,"On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I walked into Wells Fargo Branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX, and I tried to cash my check issued from XXXX XXXX  w an option to be payable through Wells Fargo Bank. I advised the Bank Teller that I had verified with XXXX Customer Service and Wells Fargo Customer Service agents via their XXXX customer service number the day prior, XX/XX/XXXX, that this would be possible. I had spent XXXX hours on the telephone verifying and providing check details and amounts that this was possible. They informed me that they would need to verify the check, and I was ideally understanding of that process. They came back XXXX minutes later, telling me that the check review was verified for funds but that they are trying to figure out how to cash it for me. Another XXXX min later, the Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ID # XXXX, informed me that the agreement between Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX  did not allow the amount of my check to be cashed. I asked her what the limits were and explained that I had called the day prior and planned and prepared for this, but no one explained that information or provided it. Another Manager walked up and stated with my check in hand that she could run the check, but it would show as processed. I asked if she would run it and process it ; I would need a guarantee of payment, and she couldn't provide me XXXX and yelled at me and said fine then. The Branch Manager, XXXX, then stated that she was not required to verify that information for me and continued to refuse to cash the check based on any other facts ; I then asked if we could call XXXX XXXX  to demonstrate what they had told me or if she could provide documented proof as to why they are refusing to cash my check. She said we are not required to help you, and you can leave now. After spending over an hour there providing my current driver 's License and Passport as identification after waiting and verifying proof of funds for the check, they did not want to process it based on allegations that could not be proven or provided. I believe this was like another instance of the banks refusing to give people their funds and abusing their power or pure discrimination, or I have been racially profiled because I am a XXXX Woman and was treated as if I shouldn't be entitled to my funds. 

My check was a settlement check and verified multiple times for {$80000.00}. I understand banks do not hold excess notes for issuance, but I also stated I was willing to take cash notes and a cashier 's check as they are all negotiable instruments and under the UCC laws that state such facts. 

I do not trust Wells Fargo, so I refuse to be cohered into opening an account and be subject to financial abuse versus cashing a check."
3/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I opened a banking account with Wells Fargo. I initiated two separate transactions, via Wells Fargo 's website, to transfer money from an external account to the Wells Fargo checking account, using the other bank 's routing and account number. Wells Fargo denies having received these two transfers, for {$500.00} and {$100.00}. 

I called the credit union that transferred the funds. They have verified that they transferred both amounts to Wells Fargo and they have sent me proof of that transfer. Wells Fargo still denies they received it a week later, and they refuse to credit my account. 

I have been on customer support with them for HOURS, and they refuse to fix this. My next step is to get a lawyer I think, even if it costs more for the lawyer that the lost funds, because this is just blatant fraud on the part of Wells Fargo. 

I have attached the proof from my credit union that the two transfers happened. They are dated XX/XX/23 ( {$500.00} ) and XX/XX/23 ( {$100.00} ). Neither of these has appeared in my Wells Fargo account."

I filed a claim on the XXXX of XX/XX/2023 with Claim No XXXX, and within 4 days, when I call them to know the status, they mentioned this claim was denied, and Wells Fargo said to contact the individual merchants by myself. 

Clearly, this claim was not investigated properly by Wells Fargo Team. I can clearly see other names on a few of the transactions. I requested them to contact me directly through the phone, by the investigation officer/ Banker who did this investigation, but no use. I requested them 4 times, but every time they are saying, XXXX ( Investigation Officer ) tried to reach me but I'm unavailable, the fact is I never received any phone call from Well Fargo. At least they have to leave a voicemail if they contacted me, I have no missed calls, or voice mail left. My phone is working fine and I can receive all other Phone calls, except the Wells Fargo Investigator phone call. 

I requested more information, about the transactions How these transactions are done, or any information that will help me to talk with the merchants, but Wells Fargo didn't provide any information. Every time they are just saying, we dont have any more information regarding the transactions. Wells Fargo is not helping me in this issue. 

I Never had any accounts with these merchants, It really hard to contact them without a registered email or phone number in their respective platforms, my phone number, Email are not registered in their accounts. I tried to reach XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX Responded and asked for information like my ID/Passport to proceed with their investigation. Other merchants are not even responding properly. 

I lost my money from my Wells Fargo checking account, The Bank is saying they cant help with this and asking me to contact the merchants. It is not the proper solution any customer expects, at least I have the right to know what happened and information regarding these transactions. Why are there other people 's names showing up on my bank statement? What investigation did Wells Fargo do in these 2 business days? 

During the transactions, I havent received any notification, email or phone call, or any information regarding these transactions. Now Wells Fargo is not helping me, I want my money back."

On XX/XX/23, I called Wells Fargo to ask to reverse the transaction. I was told by the representation that since the name on the account would not match the name on the ACH, it would bounce back. 

On XX/XX/23, I called the bank again indicating the ACH had not reversed itself. They opened an case ( case # : XXXX ) and was told that I would receive a call within a day or two. 

On XX/XX/23, I called the bank again since I did not hear back from them. I was told the case was opened by mistake. Since I used direct pay, per the terms and conditions I was out of luck and it was too bad. 

Upon asking for next level I was told the same. I asked how it can be reversed and was told the receiver would have to initiate it. The receiver has a Wells Fargo account but they would not check with them to see if they want to reverse. I obviously don't know who the account holder is.

They had their friends park in front my house defacing my property with tire marks. I have it all recorded on my door bell camera. This was done in retaliation of my complaint. Somebody at Wells Fargo said the reason my account was closed was because I harassed XXXX XXXX. 

Well I have proof now they are harassing me. The time was recording when they started hitting their car alarm. I wasn't doing nothing for them to act like grammar school kids. 

If they had looked at the Bank security footage or spoke with the banker I was working with. They would see I wasn't harassing XXXX XXXX. The police didn't arrest me either. The harassment charges has been dropped because I got a lawyer. XXXX XXXX tried to set me up to get me arrested. 

I have no interest or car to go around XXXX XXXX. But she intentionally comes around me to falsely accused me of harassing her because she got away with it once. I never harassed XXXX XXXX. I don't care what Wells Fargo managers if they think I have. 

XXXX XXXX was giving car loans to her friends but wanted to financially ruined me and trying to make me homeless. 

XXXX XXXX had no right to have people over to harass me and my son. Then XXXX of their friends road raged out of the neighborhood. I have all the footage of the harassment recorded.

They called, verified that the message she received was Wells Fargo, verified our bank account information and directed her to pull all the accounts money, up to {$17000.00}, and directed her to deposit the money into another account under the pretense that they were representing Wells Fargo and were in the account. The scammers also had personal social security, address information, and family information that was stored on the Wells Fargo accounts to verify that they were with Wells Fargo. 

The Wells Fargo bank allowed both our savings and checking accounts to be cleaned out in the same visit. The bank did not ask questions and allowed for the accounts to be wiped instantly. We have claims with the Wells Fargo bank account but they are denying the claims.

3/9/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with additional products or services purchased with the loan,"Dear CFBP, I am writing to follow up on my complaint against Wells Fargo, which I submitted to Wells Fargo in XXXX of last year. I have yet to receive any response from Wells Fargo regarding the issues that I raised, and it has now been several months since I first brought this matter to their attention. 

My complaint concerns the illegal repossession of my vehicle, fraudulent activity, and false financial statements made by Wells Fargo. I believe that their actions have caused significant financial and emotional harm to me and my family, and I am eager to see this matter resolved as soon as possible. 

Given the lack of response from Wells Fargo, I am growing increasingly concerned about the progress of my case. I urge you to take swift action to hold them accountable for their actions and to ensure that I receive a fair and just resolution to this matter. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon."
3/9/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Banking errors,"In XXXX I had an issue with an outside entity where they claimed I was refunded to much money by my bank from them. The contacted the bank without my consent speaking with an associate in regard to the issue and requested information on my behalf on my account. The representative provided this entity my banking statement from my personal account without my written consent or being present. She emailed a copy of my statement to them and in which they forwarded the email with the attachment of the statement from the associate that provided it to them. When I made an official complaint to Wells Fargo through the necessary steps I in return received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that this was resolved on their part and were not going to be moving forward in any action. This was very invasive and with the breach of privacy and violation of my federal rights providing protected information to an outside entity without my written consent. Furthermore, Wells Fargo has continued to charge me overdraft fees after the transfer of my own funds that are available at the time between my shared savings/ checking with them. Im the event funds were not available the transaction would not be possible yet later for transfer of available funds from either my checking to savings or vice versa I would later be charged an overdraft fee. Ive complained of technological errors with the company for years now slowing processes causing issues such as fees being charged. The customer is never right in these situations and I continue to pay fee after fee because of the lack of response and errors that are not up to date and slow processes causing errors. Most recently I was charged a 35 overdraft fee for a transaction posted where I was given the extra day grace period put in place to satisfy funds. I then transferred funds from my Wells Fargo shared saving into my checking and deposited cash into the ATM ti satisfy the charge before I was to incur a fee in the alotted amount of time. I retained the receipt from the ATM that then showed the positive balance before the days end. The account was later assessed a 35over draft fee for this same transaction. I took my receipt into the bank during a consult with a banker, showed her the positive balance reflected on the receipt and date that the transaction took place in order to avoid having the fee charged within the alotted amount of time of the extra day grace period. The CSR then informed me she would not be allowed to reverse the fee associated with the transaction. We then submitted a formal complaint including the receipt reflecting the date the transaction took place and the positive balance in hopes to resolve the issue and to address the concerns once again with the issues with the technology causing to charge a fee.. I recieved notification from Wells Fargo that they would not be refunding the fee and no further action would be taken place and to consider the problem resolved. Needless to say I have been a customer for about 15 years, this is an ongoing problem where there should be no problem whatsoever when the physical evidence was provided yet according to Wells Fargo the computer was right because it said something different days later than the actual physical proof from their ATM at the bank location. I no longer feel my information is safe if that I am valued as a customer because my concerns get swept under the rug and the Bank is right even where and when I have proof, my rights have been violated with my financial information being offered to an outside entity and I no longer feel protected by a company that I have been loyal to and have given my business and referred other to for long 15 years I have offered my contributions. This is a serious matter that needs to be investigated so that people like myself or other younger naieve children wont be put in this position with someone that we are all suppose to be able to trust and claims to have promised that as consumers we are protected by Wells Fargo and that they can be trusted but instead they are ripping us off and leaving us to reap the aftermath of their blood sucking just so that they can profit and dont seem wrong or to conceal the evidence of the issue that continues to take place why we are XXXX of our funds which some dont have much of .. with issues such as this driving one into a deeper darker hole and causing more stress and anxiety leading to issues with mental, physical or emotional distress that could other wise be prevented if they would take proper and preventative action and care about the people who make their business possible and listen proactively and demonstrate action."

3/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I have been unable to monitor my bank accounts properly for about a month due to hospitalization after car accident. During this time I am not sure who had access to my cards or phone. Upon coming home I noticed that both of my bank accounts had activity in the past month that were not just recurrent payments. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo for transactions from XXXX, stating that my last known transaction was from XXXX from XXXX for an amount of {$10.00}. These small transactions over the month totaled to around {$600.00}. Wells Fargo has denied my claim and I have talked to multiple representatives who all have different reasonings for why it was denied, all of which do not makes sense. One claim totaled 40 transactions with a total of {$510.00}, another of 10 transactions of {$120.00}, and a final one of 10 transactions of {$130.00}. The representatives were rude and disrespectful. I have spoken to all merchants involved who say I need to speak with my bank and that my account with them was hacked. Wells Fargo responded to my previous complaint with the same exact response, which is not a response. "" we found compelling evidence supporting the decision that was already communicated to you. We agree with the decision made by the Claims Assistance Center to deny your claim as we found the charges were made by you and no bank or processing error occurred. At this time, we respectfully decline your request for reimbursement. Please consider this claim closed '' Again they do not state the "" compelling evidence '' and I'm confused about how a XXXX  individual in a different state made these transactions? So I will not be considering this case closed, and I will be taking this to a lawyer if I have to, and continuing to file complaints with the CFPB. They then tried again to call me at almosXXXX XXXX XXXX at night one evening. Their feedback back was not helpful, and they know that no police station will take me seriously if I walk in. Wells Fargo is losing a customer for sure because I will never trust them with my money again. I have cancelled my account and have tried to call WellsFargo multiple times regarding their feedback that they required additional information. I was hung up on twice before actually speaking to a representative who told me they did not know what additional information that was needed so they needed to reopen a complaint just to then receive an email saying it was closed because I did not provide the additional information!! How about someone actually call me on the phone and ask for the information. Or when I call back not hang up on me"
3/9/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"In XXXX, a series of 17 hard-to-detect ( not high enough to raise my online alarm ) amounts of money were taken systematically from my accounts with Wells Fargo ( between the dates of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ). I was in the middle of a job shift and merging accounts with my new spouse, and in the transitions we did not notice for several months. By the time we did, the amount tallied up to {$5900.00} When I discovered the accounts were rapidly depleting, I made a call to Wells Fargo requesting the reimburse the funds stolen, since the account was insured by policy, and they agreed to look into the incident and fill the account with a temporary allowance till the matter was resolved. When the situation was resolved they agreed to return the remaining difference indefinitely. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a mailed response from Wells Fargo stating they would not return the funds insured, because they were convinced the funds went into an account that belonged to me. When I sought legal counsel, Wells Fargo froze the account, not requiring payment, but seemingly adding interest to what they claimed was owed. When I asked they would not look further into the incident. My legal counsel requested that I ask for the name of the employees or office that confirmed the account my funds were transferred to ( i.e. stolen from ) belonged to me, but when I requested this information it was withheld."
3/9/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Commencing on or about XX/XX/2021, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX ( the Company ) which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my XXXX XXXXXXXX account to Wells Fargo at the instructions of the scammers."
3/9/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I have been a retired XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email supposedly from the company XXXX that set me up to be victimized by a scam. That email contained an invoice for a bonus purchase from XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$790.00}. The email ( see # XXXX attachment ) also stated : If you have any questions about this invoice, simply reach out to our support team for help, number ( XXXX ) XXXX. Since I had not made the purchase, I called that number, received an apology, and was told by the XXXX agents I was talking to, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, that the {$790.00} would be returned to my Wells Fargo bank account then ending in # XXXX. This is where the deception began. 
The XXXX agent then told me that to show their appreciation, XXXX would transfer {$790.00} plus {$200.00}, totaling {$1000.00} back into my account. He then pulled up a form on my computer screen and told me to type in {$1000.00}. In that instant, my computer image became skewed and I couldnt see what I was typing. The XXXX agent immediately squealed and told me I had entered {$10000.00}, that went into my Wells Fargo Prime Checking Account, the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California. 
I told the XXXX agent I could call Wells Fargo and have the money transferred back to XXXX. The agent then told me that he could lose his job with XXXX and that an investigation could be launched. I then received an email from the XXXX XXXX XXXX threatening to file a case against me if I didnt return the {$10000.00} to XXXX XXXX see # XXXX attachment ). The agent, XXXX XXXX, suggested I withdraw the {$10000.00} and use it to purchase gift cards to repay XXXX. I was confused, but I was also desperate to get that unauthorized {$10000.00} out of my Wells Fargo checking account, so I withdrew the {$10000.00} that had been accidentally deposited in my account then purchased gift cards and sent the ID numbers on the cards to the XXXX agent ( see # XXXX attachment ). 
I had just completed that task, when I notice unusual activity in my computer ( a cursor moving about on its own ), which I reported to my internet server, XXXX, and they changed my log-in information. I then noticed a new XXXX XXXX XXXX Account # ending in XXXX, opened on my Wells Fargo Account Summary page, which had I never requested. I then notice a {$10000.00} withdrawal from that account. I called Wells Fargo to report a possible fraud and requested that account be closed, but not before another {$4000.00} was withdrawn from it, making the debt {$14000.00}. Although Wells Fargo closed the account, they have been continuously, unfairly charging interest on that account, and it is now over {$17000.00}, and on an account I never used or received a card for. My complaint is not only against the scammers who perpetrated this fraud, but particularly Wells Fargo Bank, .who was negligent in stopping it and for attempting to profit from it by charging me interest in their account I never asked for or received a card for my use. 
I have received a letter from Wells Fargo, dated XX/XX/XXXX, offering me a deal to pay only {$6900.00} of that {$17000.00}, but I dont feel I should have to pay any portion of it because I never requested that account to be opened in the first place, nor did I ever it. 
I will appreciate any guidance you can give me. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I NEVER let my account sit in negatives so I was trying to get it taken care of as soon as possible. It was around mid XXXX at this point. I did not hear back and then in the beginning of XXXX I got an email saying the account XXXX is being closed I decided to go to my local bank in XXXX OR to see what was going on and they said I had to make an appointment so I made an appointment for the next available day and then I got an email saying that my credit card is being closed. I called about the fraud claim that I had submitted about the XXXX and they finally told me nothing could be done, so when I went to my appointment at Wells Fargo I thought I could pay off the {$2000.00} and get my credit card back working, since this had just happened. I paid the {$2000.00} that I owed from being scammed. My banker told me I could reapply for another credit card, so I tried reapplying for a credit card with wells fargo and was denied. I made another appointment with my banker and he said he could submit a claim about this issue and get it to higher ups, so I had him submit the claim # XXXX. which turned into case # XXXX Since XXXX I have spent several hours on the phone multiple days a week trying to get answers speaking with higher ups, made over 4 appointments at the local bank near me and had my banker speak and submit a statement, and I have had to be the one to contact Wells Fargo on every occasion about this issue.

If you just look at my credit card record you would know I am not delinquent and the fact that I had an open claim and they shut my account down while it was being investigated is not right.

Because of where we live we have homeowners {$7000.00} and winstorm {$11000.00} on our home. On XX/XX/22 our windstorm was cancelled by XXXX, then by XXXX and all of the windstorm insurance companies pulled out of the market. My wife is an insurance agent for XXXX and XXXX she tried through XXXX and XXXX and many other agents to find coverage. We found that there were either no insurance companies available or the premium is {$100000.00} ( yes, you are reading this correctly. As we continued to search for windstorm insurance Wells Fargo said that they were going to force place coverage for {$83000.00} for a coverage of {>= $1,000,000}. We have done many insurance applications and know that the replacement cost on our home is {>= $1,000,000} not {>= $1,000,000}. The {>= $1,000,000} is the amount of Windstorm coverage that Wells Fargo approved when we refinanced. And the amount we were carrying on the house when the windstorm was cancelled. Also, in my XXXX years of home ownership I have never submitted a claim. 
Not only is Wells fargo trying to charge {$83000.00} but it is on coverage that is double. I called and spoke to XXXX in insurance twice and told her to look at the original loan documents and requirements which would show the {>= $1,000,000} windstorm coverage requirement. Not surprising she did not get back to me and today I received paperwork for the forced place policy of {>= $1,000,000} with a premium of {$83000.00}. Something needs to be done Wells Fargo is gauging us with double the coverage that should be required and we can not get any reasonable windstorm insurance quotes for coverage. It is criminal that Wells Fargo is using the insurance crisis to take advantage of clients in a time of desperation and to further gauge the client by doubling the coverage requirement from what it was. this has to be illegal. I need help otherwise may lose the home that I have worked so hard to keep because of Wells Fargo unscupulous practices. I need help!!!

3/10/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"Re : Complaint against Wells Fargo Financial Bank Attn : XXXX from XXXXxecutive Office Phone XXXX X XXXX I have a Wells Fargo credit card and a Wells Fargo Mortgage. I pay my credit card bill by phone each month because Wells Fargo does not accept savings account payments online. Sometime in late XXXX or early XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo switched their Wells Fargo Financial Credits Cards to what they call a Cash Card. As of XX/XX/XXXX my Wells Fargo credit card payments no longer will go through because Wells Fargo says the account is closed. I tried to explain the account is not closed because I pay my bills through that account every month including my Wells Fargo Mortgage Payments. There is no problem with the mortgage payments each month they get processed just fine. The problem is only with the Wells Fargo Cash Credit Card payments. Since XX/XX/XXXX, every credit card payment Ive made to Wells Fargo each month was returned due to my account being closed however my mortgage payments go through that same account without a problem. Wells Fargo keeps insisting its my Financial Institution thats the problem. I keep telling them if the mortgage payment goes through just fine why wont the credit card payment go through. Ive spoken with several people from the Wells Fargo Executive Office and I keep being told its my Financial Institution or they will look into the situation. Each time the problem gets handed back to XXXX who tells me the same thing, its my financial institution. The Iast conversation was with XXXX this time she told me Wells Fargo could not fix the situation. I even explained that the programmers needed to go back and fix the problem since the problem generated with the new credit card transition. XXXX says Wells Fargo is not going to fix the problem and I need to either go to a branch and pay my bill that way, or mail my payment in, I said its a savings account, theres nothing to mail and Im XXXX its hard to get around. XXXX suggested I have my credit card payments automatically withdrawn. I asked how when your system keeps indicating my account is closed for the credit card payments. I should not have to go through all these changes. Im not getting anywhere with Wells Fargo. Theyve closed my credit card account because my payments are behind due to them being returned. Again I said its the same account I pay my mortgage through each month so the account is not closed. Now Im receiving email messages about debt consolidation with Wells Fargo. 
Please respond and or advise. 

Sincerely, My first communication with you regarding this was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I didnt mean to be lengthy in my response but Ive been trying to find a resolution on my own for months dealing with Wells Fargo Financial Bank Employees and this major inconvenience their causing me. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email response from Wells Fargo Bank Rep, XXXX XXXX Executive Office Case Specialist, XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ; XXXX, Case number : XXXX, that my concerns were appropriately address on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The phone conversation on that date was no way appropriate. The Wells Fargo Executive clearly dismissed and ignored the issues with meaningless words of nonsense which is the same responses Ive received since XX/XX/XXXX, when this problem started. Wells Fargo implemented their new payment system and issued New Cash Cards. I was told Wells Fargo Financial no XXXX longer existed so the old credit cards were replaced with the New Cash Card. Their new payment system for the Cash Card will no longer accept my credit card payments. They keep insisting my account is closed. Ive tried to explain my account is not closed. My Wells Fargo Mortgage is withdrawn from that same account each month just fine, no problems, but Wells Fargo is refusing to fix their new payment system that will allow me to continuing making my card payments. 

The conversation between the Wells Fargo Executive and myself on XX/XX/XXXX, went as follows : Executive : Our new payment system will no longer accept payments from your credit union account. Yes we know your payments use to process and your mortgage is still being paid from that same account each month with no issues. ( Wells Fargo keeps insisting its my financial institution thats the problem. ) Thats so not true. 
Executive : However Wells Fargo is not going to fix their payment system. You need to go to a Wells Fargo Branch and pay that way each month or have your payments automatically withdrawn I said : Either way Im still using the same account for the payments. That makes no sense. 

Executive : Thats all I can tell you. Those are your options. 

We ended the phone conversation. ( Play it back and listen )."

However, per XXXX that have repeatedly reached out to Wells Fargo and have not received a response.

I also imagine I am not the only consumer with a bank waiting on a response from Wells Fargo or XXXX. 

I was a victim of mail check fraud in XXXX XXXX, as a result of the armed theft of XXXX XXXX from U.S. Mail carriers in the XXXX region XXXX As the first anniversary of my theft approaches, I am still awaiting restitution of the {$14000.00} in stolen funds from my XXXX bank account. Per XXXX, they are still waiting to hear from Wells Fargo, the recipient bank that cashed my fraudulently altered check and, since Wells Fargo does not have any real presence in Ohio, this if further complicating the timely resolution of my case, per XXXX. I have also been told by XXXX that there are no rules regulating timeframes for the banks to respond. However, as a customer, I had 20 days, per XXXX policy, to respond and prove the fraud or I would lose all future rights to any claim or restoration of my funds. I have complied with all of XXXX 's request for information and filing of XXXX Police and Inspector General reports and within the 20 day required timeframe and all of these documents have been provided to XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX 

It has been challenging to receive any detailed information about my case, anticipated timeframes or even additional actions I can take as a consumer on my behalf, including where to complain. While everyone at XXXX has been cordial and sympathetic, that has clearly not resulted in the expeditious restoration of my fraudulently stolen funds and has not moved Wells Fargo to respond to XXXX. 

My request is full restoration of my funds with interest by XXXX XXXX XXXX, which, as I understand it, requires Wells Fargo to respond and work with XXXX. The XXXX reference number for my case is XXXX. The checking account # is XXXX. 

In addition, expanded Federal regulations that will better protect consumers, improve transparency about this issue and mandate timeframes for responding, communicating and restoring stolen funds appears to be needed. In an ideal world, the Banks would step up to do this in the interest of customer service but I am doubtful that will occur without further Federal intervention. 

Please let me know what additional information you may require and I am best reached on my cell ( XXXX ) XXXX. Thank you in advance for contacting Wells Fargo."

They told me they were making a report to the XXXX police dept so I can get reimbursed for the XXXX. 
They told me to verify my old PIN number and Email address to get the funds back in order. They told me not to go on the online app because it will cause an issue getting the money back. I thought that sounded fishy. So I went on the app anyway. Realizing they took every cent out of my account, checking and savings. I was furious. I asked them why my savings was transferred and they said it was "" part of the process. '' I knew i was being scammed so I just hung up the phone.

I was in a forbearance in XXXX that was supposed to help me. But I was afraid to not pay. I paid my payments over the phone and was told the payments were going into a suspense account. I have not seen those payments show up anywhere it was like I paid that money and it disappeared but guess what. Around XXXX there was a XXXX oil spill lawsuit and lawyer had us pull all our bank statements from XXXX, XXXX & XXXX to prove income. So I have those payments posted on a grow XXXX XXXX XXXX bank statement. Yet wells Fargo states they have no record of my payments. And during the process of that modification in XXXX. I WAS NEVER TOLD I HAD TO BE 90 DAYS LATE! I was offered a forbearance in XXXX So I have proof those payments and proof wells Fargo is continuing to tell lies about my case why? After my husbands layoff XX/XX/XXXX I call wells Fargo and was TOLD I HAD TO BE 90 DAYS LATE IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR A HAMP MODIFICATION. I NEVER HEARD PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY THAT!!!! WE ALL KNOW AT XXXX THE PMI INSURNACE PAYS OFF THE MORTGAGE. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent all my documents XXXX XXXX to wells Fargo ( in my last modification I faxed everything and every 2 weeks I would call and I was told they didnt receive all my documents so the forbearance last well over 4 months adding XXXX to the modification yet as I said before the payments I made were never recorded anywhere ). I called wells Fargo with a XXXX counsellor XX/XX/XXXX and was told they have all my documents and the application was going to underwriting. About a week later. I get a call from underwriting and she said someone into her computer on her day off and moved my file out of review and she could not get it back in. she cried and I cried.

My case had been referred for foreclosure.

And XXXX XXXXXXXX has the audacity and knowledge to tell me that I should have paid the modification the foreclosure proceedings would have stopped? I think wells Fargo didnt count on the internet taking off as it did and that XXXX became a thing in XXXX. We found out the documents were being shredded. Whistle blowers were telling us this. And people were paying the trial modifications that XXXX XXXX sent me and guess what they were paying them and guess what they paid for 12 months to XXXX yrs. and foreclosure proceedings were never stopped and people were losing their homes even though they were paying.

Just trying to make money from innocent people. They are giving me false information I believe this is due to my accent and that I am not originally from this country
3/10/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"After a thorough review of a copy my mortgage documents acquired at closing, I came across several discrepancies. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to Wells Fargo outlining a contractual outstanding amount of {$160000.00}, that was never paid nor given to me, but outlined in my mortgage contract. Wells Fargo responded, admitting that no record exists of this amount being disbursed, transferred nor given to me. However, even with this confirmation, Wells Fargo continues to dishonor this part and many other sections of the mortgage contract agreement. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an affidavit with 7 days to respond, to Wells Fargo, along with an invoice outlining over 15 continued failure to comply with US Code, state laws and Federal Laws resulting in an estimated sum of {>= $1,000,000} in damages. Receipt of the affidavit was confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX by the post office : XXXX : XXXX XXXX I received a letter response back from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX with no dispute, rebuttal nor challenge to the facts laid out in the affidavit, and therefore serves as Wells Fargo 's acceptance of all facts, allegations, violations and damages stated in the affidavit."
3/10/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Closing on a mortgage,None,"I have filed a complaint and the information that Wells Fargo sent is incorrect. According to Wells Fargo, I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX and then got a job during the process of buying the house. I had been employed XXXX years. I was employed less than a month which warrants further investigation. This is a HELOC loan given in 2005 when Wells Fargo admittingly was offering fraudulent loans to unsuspecting victims like myself. This is predatory behavior and as per their statement, I did not have the income if you look further into this complaint. Full-time XXXXXXXX XXXX  means no job. On top of this, they could not have figured out my monthly income based on the XXXX years I had worked. The XXXX was not below the 50 % when factored in the less than a month work and before taxes. Again, if you actually investigate this you will see the predatory behavior that is clearly shown on this account. I am tired of being the victim of this bank and I need assistance in these fraudulent charges and how they preyed on a XXXX XXXX XXXX right out of XXXXXXXX XXXX with no savings and less than a month of work."
3/10/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"Dear cfpb I am writing to report a case of retaliation from XXXX  regarding my previous complaint, and I am hoping that the relevant authorities can oversee and manage this matter. 
The retaliation includes : 1.Delaying the payment of my rent check, causing my rent to be paid five days late, resulting in my credit being severely damaged, and being charged a late fee.

2.Repetitive payment of rent causing my credit card balance to exceed {$4000.00}. 

3.After discovering the problem, I contacted XXXX through various channels, including phone calls and chat windows, but no one responded or resolved the issue. Instead, they just kept passing the buck to different departments, with no one answering my call. 

According to our rental agreement, I am required to pay my rent before the XXXX of every month. However, I recently discovered that the rent check that I mailed on the XXXX of XXXX, as indicated by my app, was actually mailed on XX/XX/2023, according to USPS delivery tracking. The final delivery date was XX/XX/XXXX, and I received a penalty of {$140.00}. My check plan is to send it out on the XXXX of each month and receive it before the XXXX of the following month. Why did this serious problem occur at this time? 

Two checks were paid, which means that my landlord has received two months ' rent, and the payment has been deducted from my account. The problem is that I have contacted the bank several times, but Wells Fargo Bank has said they can not cancel this payment, and I must be transferred to the rental payment department. However, this is not feasible because after the transfer, it requires a call back or information contact. I have used both methods and waited for 24 hours, but I did not receive any call back or SMS reply. 

The next day, I tried to contact the bank again and was transferred to a place where there was no response at all. My account was debited {$2600.00} for two days, and my unsuccessful attempts to contact XXXX have been frustrating and unacceptable. Canceling an unnecessary payment should be a simple task, but it has wasted two days of my time without any resolution. I request that the relevant regulatory authorities require this company to improve its service quality and help me retrieve {$1300.00}. The other check can be cashed out by my landlord. I no longer have confidence in this company. If my landlord fails to cash out successfully, or if I have paid an additional fee and have not received a refund, the credit card company will be responsible. 

To summarize, I hope that this is not the case, but I strongly suspect that this is a retaliatory act from XXXX  against my previous complaint. It has severely affected my personal credibility, disrupted my personal life, and caused me serious mental harm. I hope that the relevant authorities will give this matter serious attention. 

Even XXXX agrees to compensate for the late fee, it is just cleaning up their own mess. It has nothing to do with my issue of why the check that was supposed to be issued on the XXXX was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. I suspect it was a retaliatory act. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I used the store card because it is 12 month interest free financing. My issue however is that upon logging into my Wells Fargo online account I am unable to make payments on my account because they have still not processed my purchase. I have continually checked my online account since I made the purchase and the charge still to this date ( XXXX XXXX XXXX a month a half later ) shows as a "" pending transaction ''. To date I have still not received a statement on the account either, the first of which should have been issued in XXXX. The online system shows that my next statement is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX but this is similar to what it showed last month ( but XXXX cited ), so likely that I will not get another statement. Periodic statements are required under TILA/Reg Z , so I am concerned that one hasn't been issued yet on my account. Furthermore, Wells Fargo 's online system will not allow me to make a payment on the account as their system states "" Your payment can not exceed your outstanding balance. Please change your payment amount. '' I have never had a delay this long on any credit card purchase posting to an account, and at this point it is preventing me from making payments that I should have the right to pay on my account prior to the end of the 12 month 0 % interest promotional period. This to me can be construed as consumer harm and resolution should be to extend the promotional period to allow consumers 12 consecutive months with the ability to make payments on the account at 0 % interest. Also, just now when I logged into my account, their online system has an alert that states "" If you see incorrect balances or missing transactions, this may be due to a technical issue and we apologize. Your accounts continue to be secure and we're working quickly on a resolution. '' This to me is not adequate customer service from one of the largest banks in the country.

On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited TWO XXXX money orders at a WF ATM in XXXX XXXX. I bought these with my debit cards next door at a post office and paid {$2.00} each. I was going to deposit cash at the branch but had to go to work and the ONE teller had 5 people on line. I put the cash in my car and used my debit cards from XXXX and XXXX to buy these 2 money orders. Somehow the next day I get a call from WF ( XXXX hours after the deposit ) that the MO are fraudulent. I said that's impossible. he said with his thick and hard-to-understand accent that I am basically a crook. My acct online said the checks are being held for 10 days to clear. Then I get a notice that my acct is being closed for fraud!!! So my account is closed with {$1000.00} in the acct which I have never received and WELLS FARGO HAS STOLEN MY XXXX MONEY ORDERS X2!!!! tHEY OWE ME THIS MONEY. it's mine. After my previous complaints to the CFPB on this matter, all I get is the standard CFBP form that WF needs more time. In the meantime, those 2 MO deposits have disappeared from my acct and I only have XXXX in it which I can not access. I did get a call from a XXXX XXXX @ XXXX ext XXXX who told me basically to shove it while she takes 10 days to look at it. I also got a call from a "" XXXX ''. both people do not return my calls.

3/11/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"I have been a Wells Fargo customer for many years. I accepted a credit card from them several years ago. They continually increased my credit limit to the extent that I can not possibly continue to pay the card and afford everyday living expenses. After consulting a consumer banking expert, I learned that the limit Wells Fargo allowed was far in excess of what should have been allowed for someone of my income level. My limit was in the {$10000.00} range for a long time and I needed additional credit to pay for college tuition and afford to take care of my toddler. Wells granted me a limit of {$16000.00}. Many months later, I surpassed that limit and was allowed to run the balance up to nearly {$26000.00} without any discussion about increasing my limit. My assumption was that if they were willing to increase my limit, then I must be able to afford the new debt because I know banks are required to have the best interest of their clients in mind. On XX/XX/XXXX I met with my Wells Fargo Branch team to discuss the situation and brought my consumer banking expert. They did not have the authority to propose any solutions so they got their complaint desk on the phone. The lady on the phone essentially told me I was completely responsible because I got my statements and should have known better. At this point, my banking expert asked the person on the phone if she or anyone else at Wells Fargo took the time to underwrite the additional credit. She responded that as long as clients continue to make at least the minimum payment, Wells Fargo assumes they can handle the credit. To put this in perspective, my Adjusted Gross Income in XXXX, the year that would have been used to review my credit worthiness, was just over {$19000.00}. We asked the complaint line person how they could underwrite giving me up to nearly {$26000.00} ( 160 % of the assigned limit ) in unsecured revolving credit with an AGI of {$19000.00}. The answer was the same as above, if you pay on time, they give you more. I am willing to accept some responsibility for using the additional money, but I also feel like I was allowed to put myself in this position with Wells Fargo as my partner in the situation. Several communications have taken place on the phone and responses by letter since that time where the same point that, "" Wells Fargo provides your account with a baseline level of credit to be utilized. As a customer who continuously makes on-time payments, Wells Fargo believes that the customer is reputable for the funds. '' My Consumer Banking Expert finds this statement incredulous. Finally, after several conversations with various complaint personnel at XXXX, I sent a certified letter to the complaint department and copied ( also certified ) XXXX XXXX ( XXXX of XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) further formalizing my complaint and asking for them to properly propose some way we can resolve this issue so that I can pay a fair amount of the debt, but also having WFC acknowledge their failure with some sort of accommodation. I gave them until XX/XX/XXXX to satisfy my request for a meaningful dialogue on how we can settle this dispute. I am under tremendous financial pressure as I have spent my daughter 's entire college savings of $ XXXX and most of my disposable monthly income trying to reduce this debt. Essentially, in trying to pay down the Wells Fargo debt, I still owe my young daughter the money I used to pay down the card. There should be some compassion by a large financial institution for a customer trying to do the right thing and pay the debt, but there seems to be no willingness by Wells Fargo to help in any way. Many people would just establish a bank account elsewhere and stop paying the card balance and let them charge it off and have their credit score suffer for 3 years. It seems that my unwillingness to completely default, gains no favor with this large and insensitive institution. Lastly, my consumer banking expert advises me that these "" credit models '' they have developed are supposed to take into account all compliance issues including fairness to the customer, and burying a customer in debt is NOT serving the customer and is not in Compliance with banking Consumer Compliance laws. Their credit models need to be fully investigated because if they are not sufficiently measuring capacity to afford debt, how could they also be sufficiently checking for other consumer compliance issues such as ECOA violations, etc.? My consumer banking expert advised me that this issue would be of interest to XXXX XXXX XXXX and his senior staff as it involves apparent lack of proper credit model development and validation and could have further implications for Consumer Compliance violations at Wells Fargo Corporation."
3/12/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"Wells Fargo has had my case since XX/XX/2022. Due to their poor security and systems to prevent fraud, they cashed a check that was stolen by their customer from the mail and meant for the University XXXX XXXX. I have given them, since XX/XX/2022, plenty of opportunity to resolve this situation and transfer my funds of {$6800.00} plus interest and all other costs of my time taken to resolve this situation. After over 6 months of waiting, my last attempt was to go through the CFPB -- and what did Well Fargo do -- again, NOTHING. Instead of resolving the situation, they claim to have tried to contact me for additional background information ( they have had everything they could have needed through paperwork filed with my bank, XXXX and Wells Fargo, as part of the agreed upon banking process ) -- I have no track of any calls or emails made to me. All I received was an obnoxious letter dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they tried and because they couldn't connect with me they have closed the case. UNACCEPTABLE AND WRONG. To make things worse, on returning from a work trip and seeing this letter, I tried the very next day and for two days to contact the number listed on the letter- XXXX XXXX, Iowa, XXXX. NO ANSWER. I have over 11 calls made to them. Closing this case without finding out from their own team charged with resolving why this has not been followed up on is insulting. Do they think it is okay to just take {$6800.00} without finding out who it really belongs to? We teach children to do the right thing and return anything that does not belong to them in a timely manner. Clearly, Wells Fargo 's customer service process is more about protecting themselves. I expect that the Bureau holds Wells Fargo accountable for this type of behavior and helps consumers like myself in fair and timely resolution."

The fraud occurred many times on days through different merchants roughly amounting up to {$15000.00} more or less. I never received notification of this specifically stating of any online purchase made. I dont have specific dates or details because the request for them to mail my statements multiple times and still never received them after they abruptly closed my accounts with no explanation. 

Unfortunately, WELLS FARGO service has not performed well ( or the service was inadequate ) because fraud communication has not been any help in resolving the issue of fraud on my account. I am dissatisfied with the service received on more then one occasion when I notified them of fraud to my account. I explained my phone and my purse stolen from out of my vehicle in the area of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As I explained in the police report filed. The 2 months Ive had to go to a branch and personally talk to banker, and said a phone call is to be made and it help with nothing. I am disappointed I do not feel like they taking my claim seriously. The obvious fraud on my account is multiple unauthorized transactions in different amounts under {$100.00}. My phone was stolen at the time and if i was notified about any fraud Never received. Also I contacted merchant of XXXX XXXX to see if they could resolve the matter I have included in my police report of them stating my card could be compromised and/or someone has personal information of account access. XXXX XXXX stated to contact my bank that i have done 3x over a total of 3 months waiting on decision. The other merchant i contacted for fraudulent is a XXXX XXXX I had to contact through email They have also said my information is compromised somebody has stolen identity to get with my bank to request fraudulent charges be charged back, they werent able to give me details on any other information. I have also turned my card off with the app after replacing my phone and other charges be charged while turned off. I am in a hardship now from this situation to not receive my funds when I contacted them for them to close my account and accuse me of a transaction authorized was included in the claim they denied the entire claim that makes no sense. I am very disappointed I was told to calm down and then when i was requesting for personal information as to transcripts of my account as well as who could help me understand why my account was closed or a letter they refused to and also hung up on me. I need help to resolve this matter as soon as possible. 


To resolve the problem, I would appreciate money back, as well as all fees and overdraft fees accumulated over the time as well as any uses of my account when my card was off. Also to understand better why my entire bank account was closed off. I have been with wells fargo for over 10years, also this account im referring to was added onto my checking account and a card received that i never personally opened I had logged into my mobile app sometime last year and it was a checking account added I didnt think nothing of it at the time but I thought it was a personal savings type of account but cone to find out its a entire new account i never personally opened. I hope we can resolve this matter in a timely state. Enclosed are copies of my records. 

I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem and will wait until XX/XX/XXXX before seeking help from a consumer protection agency or XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please contact me at the above address or by phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX.

3/12/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I Noticed fraudulent charges on my wells fargo account made out to an online sports betting platform. I immediately took action by notifying my bank about the fraudulent charges, I filed a police report and I looked up the merchant who the charges were made out to and wrote them an email notifying them about the fraudulent activity taking place and advised to investigate the matter and provide me with any related information regarding the account. 

I filed a police report and provided the police with all the charges and information I had and got a police report number that I relayed to my bank claims specialist to include in my claim. 

The wells fargo bank representative assisting me with the claim filed a fraud claim with me over the phone including all the charges totaling {$17000.00} and advised me that wells fargo will freeze the account and make sure nothing else gets charged to my account, I was given a reference # referencing the freeze and instructed me to make an appointment with a banker to set up a new account with a new account number. I was advised that the bank will investigate the matter within 10 business days and if more time is needed they will issue a temporary credit for the disputed amount. 

on XXXX XXXX, logged into my account and noticed XXXX new transaction totaling {$6800.00} charged to my account from the same merchant dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX after I was given a reference # for the freeze on my account. I was devastated and called the bank to inquired about the new charges given that my account was supposedly frozen I was given someone else to speak to that seemed to have no knowledge about the freeze of whats going on and gave me misleading information, asks me the same questions as if I am starting the whole process from scratch. It was very frustrating, I then decided to call the next day and escalate the call to a higher rank specialist with no help or results other than the standard statements read to me previously. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I call the bank again and reached a claim 's specialist, I explained my case and I was advised that I will be issued a provisional credit to my account within 24-48hrs which gave me some hope and relief. on business day 10 of filing the claim, I still had not seen a provisional credit to my account so i called the bank again and the results were "" Sorry, the claim was denied '' I asked to escalate the claim and was asked to provide the same supporting documents of the police report and the explanation of the fraudulent charges I already provided before. At that point it became obvious I keep getting the run around and thrown to someone else that asks me for the same things that I provided to the previous specialist causing a chaos on the progress of investigating the claim resulting in bogus conclusions from honoring wells fargo "" zero-liability '' protection policy against fraud related matters."

I immediately called to report. Was given a Case number On XXXX XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo stating there had been a {$1000.00} deposit made into my checking account, but because they 'could not find the account ', they took out {$1000.00} plus a {$12.00} service from my checking account. ( I never made such a deposit, nor was there a deposit shown in my account. ) I again, immediately called to report. Was give another Case number For the following week, I called to check on status of these fraudulent activities. I also emailed a local Wells Fargo banker, who made a call on my behalf. Supposedly this call 'expedited ' the claims, but that did not occur. I also sent an email to the Wells Fargo Board of Communications, and received a form letter back. 

Friday XXXX XXXX, I noticed the {$700.00} was deposited back into my savings account without an explanation as to where this occurred or how. I called WF to ask them to please let me know, but they did not do that. 

On Monday, XXXX XXXX, during a call, I was given the name of a XXXX XXXX, as the person who was my 'case specialist '. I called his number, XXXX, to check on the status, but was told it would be another 10 days. 

On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, I received via my home mail, a copy of the {$1000.00} check in question, from Wells Fargo. It was a check that was clearly not my signature, and names who I did not know at all, and a bank I did not know. 

Wed., XXXX XXXX I again immediately called Wells Fargo to report I had received this check in the mail. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 42 mins. During this call, I was told that the case was 'closed ', and that the notes said I needed to contact the people on the check. I again insisted, this was a fraudulent activity, and I have no idea who these people are, nor is my signature mine. At THIs point, a hard hold was put on my account, and a NEW number was given. 

Thursday-called XXXX XXXX Police Department to file a report, and set up an appointment in the local WF branch with the hope of getting this situation resolved. 

Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, -called WF again to get a status. At THIS time, I was told the previous numbers were closed, and was given a NEW number, yet again! 

Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, -received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX with two NEW case numbers, stating he was still working on the case. 

Sat., XX/XX/XXXX, met with police officer and gave him evidence of the copy of the check, pictures of the transaction where WF took out {$1000.00} from my account due to a fraudulent transaction. Looking at my drivers license signature he saw several instances confirming it was not my signature on the back of the check. He is also reaching out to WF, but is not hopefully due to their dealings with WF in the past, and that they are a difficult bank for cooperation. 

I just called again this morning for a status update, and there is NONE! I am absolutely at my wits end as to what to do. I have been a victim of Wells Fargo fraud for a month, and all I get when I contact them is the run around, new numbers, and a total lack of willingness to speak to me. XXXX XXXX has not returned either call I made last week, even after leaving voice messages, asking him to please call. This is {$1000.00}. XXXX out of my checking account ... my bill paying account, and I am without it for a month!! Totally inexcusable."

I argued that the appraisal I got through my XXXX XXXX XXXX is also an independent, certified appraisal who is not affiliated with the customer ( me ) or you Wells Fargo.

3/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"The Following 3 Case No. I submitted to the CFPB, all regarding the same issue with Wells Fargo. 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, case number : XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , case number : XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , case number : XXXX As I have stated in my previous 3 complaints, I have tried to file a Fraud Claim numerous times with Wells Fargo 's Fraud Department. Finally, on XX/XX/2023, I was able to file the complaint for fraud except now Wells Fargo is stating they have no record of the claim. So here is the complaint and if XXXX XXXX, Executive Office Case Specialist in the XXXX Complaints Management Office, wants to take the time and actually read the complaint and respond accordingly and not the way in which she thinks she should then we can move to the next step. I have tangible evidence regarding this claim for Fraud that I submitted on XX/XX/2023, and XXXX XXXX wants to state as she has in the last 3 complaints then I will have no other choice but to take legal action against XXXX XXXX in the XXXX Complaints Management Office, XXXX in the Fraud Department, both for not doing their jobs and Wells Fargo for allowing Fraud to take place and not willing to take the necessary action that should be taken by law. 

On XX/XX/2023, at approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX at the Branch located XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CT, I met with a Senior Premier Banker that works for Wells Fargo and I sat in the Sr. Bankers office and filed the Fraud Claim with XXXX in the Fraud Department . I was at the Branch for over 2 hours and I finally had to leave as I had another appointment. XXXX was asked and she confirmed that she would be emailing me the Case number for the Fraud Claim, but it was taking her a bit longer because she had to manually enter the checks that I provided to her as Fraud. 

XXXX XXXX, who has responded to my 3 complaints submitted to the CFPB has not answered the complaints and although she stated that I have not reported new information, she is wrong. XXXX XXXX, just like Wells Fargo are both trying to waste time and not answer the complaint. The call was recorded that I had with XXXX in the Fraud Department at Wells Fargo as it was stated to me at the beginning of the call placed in the Wells Fargo Branch in XXXX, CT with the Sr. Banker sitting in the same office with me and both of us spoke with XXXX in the Fraud Department at Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2023. Why is the claim not filed and why do I not have a Case Number for the Fraud Claim I submitted to XXXX in the Fraud Department? Is it possible that XXXX XXXX is also trying to brush this complaint under the carpet? I am not going to stop filing complaints with the CFPB till Wells Fargo accepts responsibility and owns up to the fact that on XX/XX/2023, from approximately XXXXXXXX XXXX till around XXXX XXXX, I was on the phone and provided XXXX in the Fraud Dept. with all the checks that I believed to be Fraud. I have a long-running track record of all the correspondence I have made with representatives at Wells Fargo and I am prepared to take this matter to the next level if, in fact, XXXX XXXX does not look into this matter as she is supposed to do. I have spoken with the Branch Manager XXXX XXXX, and the Senior Premier Banker, in the XXXX, CT Wells Fargo Branch, on Friday, XX/XX/2023, when I drove to the location to speak with them in person regarding the issue with Wells Fargo Fraud Department not having any claim on file. Both bank representatives were very shocked and are assisting me with this matter as well as the District Manager who the Branch Manager is going to get involved with to help find out what can be done.

The SAME day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received an email back from WELLS FARGO stating the claim investigation had been completed for account ending in XXXX and I would receive mail with the decision. I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX that the claim investigation for account ending XXXX had been completed and I would receive mail with the decision. 

I got the mail with the decision for both accounts and was told that I, or someone I gave permission to, made the charges on my account. With what information and resources WELLS FARGO used to come to this conclusion I am not sure. I tried to explain to WELLS FARGO that I physically had my cards with me at the time of the transactions and I am located in a totally different city. I was told that the claim was final and there was no way to appeal the decision. Now my account ending in XXXX is in a negative and I'm out $ XXXX. 

I believe WELLS FARGO did not actively look into my claims and sent automatic responses based on inaccurate information, as a consumer I am disappointed and confused. There is no way I could be in 2 places at one time, I never share my PIN nor card information. I've heard of scammers stripping cards using some type of skimmer on card machines at stores consumers usually shop at. I believe I have been a victim of such and WELLS FARGO does not care."

Case # XXXX Today I received a letter stating that Wells Fargo needs more time to "" complete our research ''. After 30 days of trying to resolve the misapplied full payment on XX/XX/XXXX directly with WF I finally contacted CFPB. Since the contact WF has "" backdated "" a payment with a XX/XX/XXXX date, However the amount credited, {$1000.00}, is still short as the amount of my payment and the amount charged to my bank and paid by my bank was {$1100.00}. WF promptly reversed their incorrectly credited amount of {$410.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. WF addressed their concerns but, as of yet has failed to address mine. XXXX XXXX accounting was done on XXXX and it appears as if WF 's accounting is no more professional. Banking transactions take place almost instantaneously with complete data tracking yet, after 6 weeks of contacts with WF, along with a complaint logged with CFPB, they now are requesting additional research time. This is beyond the pale. 

( This was my original complaint Case # XXXX ) YOUR COMPLAINT I sent a payment to pay the balance in full for the month in the amount of {$1100.00}. Wells Fargo only credited {$410.00}. They posted the receipt the incorrect amount on XX/XX/XXXX. My bank paid the full amount of the check to Wells Fargo which was drawn the {$1100.00} from my bank on the same date. I have contacted Wells Fargo numerous times over the last 30 days to no avail. I have had to write a check to pay the most recent statement in full although the amount of that statement has yet to be adjusted for the credit due to Wells Fargo 's misapplication of the previous payment. Wells Fargo 's last position is that it would take them another 30 days to "" investigate ''. It is time that a higher source intervene in this issue."

A Wells Fargo representative called me from the Mediation department, she informed me that she doesnt handle my particular type of case. This is further proof of the continuing process of Wells Fargos policies that loop through an endless system, that doesnt assist the customer. I am again referred back to a Team that hadnt properly assisted me for the Home Equity Loan repayment. WELLS FARGO I am having serious issues with Wells Fargo Bank. I have processed several claims against them for their practices. Currently, I am having issues with obtaining modification of a Home Equity Loan. They asked me to process the paperwork, and they declined the information based on what they called as occupancy. I recently spoke with a representative in the XXXX office and told them it says on their website, what I needed to do for a Hardship, Proof of Occupancy and Property Tax Statement. They also sent me a letter asking me to prove that I had Home Owners Insurance, since they are the Lien Holder, which I provided. They are still trying to say that they are declining based on their proprietary rules on occupancy that I dont qualify. I asked to show me in writing about other rules pertaining to or based on occupancy, they told me they could not because it is proprietary. How does Wells Fargo have rules clearly defined on their website of what is needed, but then say they are declining based on rules, I cant see or dont know about and they cant produce in writing. The XXXX representative then proceeded to say, hewill try to place something in writing and send it to me ( for two long years they havent placed anything in writing for this issue, now they will send something in writing? ). I have provided everything they asked for and much more. I have provided extra Paystubs, Gas Bills , Electric Bills, Water, Sewerage, Flood Insurance, Home Owners Insurance, and Taxes. It has has been two years, I could have a significant amount of payments by now, but they are using this one rule to consistently deny me the opportunity to make payments. I will next be placed in full foreclosure ( I had already received a pre foreclosure notice ).

I believe that I was legitimately injured by Wells Fargo 's actions while managing my home mortgage. I believe that my inconveniences should be remediated through inclusion in the CFPB settlement. 

The mismanagement of my mortgage took place when : ( 1 ) I was told I would qualify for a modification, but only after going into arrears ; ( 2 ) being denied a modification, multiple times, because the mortgage type could not be modified ( not true! ) ; ( 3 ) if the mortgage truly could not be modified, I should have been told that when I first requested a modification before going into arrears ; ( 4 ) the house being sold in foreclosure even though the mortgage could be modified.

I proceeded with the redemption option only to be informed that due to the stipulation found within the agreement I signed with the City, Wells Fargo could not release the vehicle directly to me. Being aware of the stipulation, I requested Wells Fargo to produce a copy of the agreement they were required to sign with the City for release of the vehicle. Since, the initial request on XXXX, no agreement has been produced and Wells Fargo continues to obfuscate and withhold information pertinent to this case. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a Wells Fargo premier lender who informed me that private sale to a third party was available for the amount indicated on the XX/XX/XXXX, {$24000.00} as the remaining loan principle. On XX/XX/XXXX I began the process of a private sale through a third party paying off the entire principle. The process was proceeding favorably until a Wells Fargo XXXX flat out informed sale to a third party was not available due to the legal stipulation. Nothing within the original loan agreement nor the agreement between me and the City precludes sale to a third party. And without a copy of the agreement signed between Wells Fargo and the City, there is no way knowing what was agreed upon. Wells Fargo also falsely stated that they would be able to keep all proceeds ( profit ) from the sale of the vehicle at public auction once the principle of the loan was factored in. That is demonstrably untrue and counter to the original loan agreement stating that all surplus from a potential public auction sale would be returned back to me. I of course would be responsible for the remaining principle of the loan should the sale price of the vehicle not meet or exceed what I owed Wells Fargo."

As of today XX/XX/XXXX the account is still blocked for use. Calling Wells Fargo and speaking to a supervisor only gave me the information : "" The department that can unblock the account can only be reached via e-mail, they will respond in 24 hours '' In addition to the issues with the payment processing the issues conveniently prevented me from taking advantage of the account sign up bonus ( XXXX points for first 5 days, XXXX points on the first of the month ) due to the account being constantly blocked for charges. 

It is totally unacceptable for a bank to be unable to resolve this issue even in the 24 hour period that they have since exceeded by weeks. It is false advertising to offer a sign up bonus that cant be achieved due to a non working card."

If I had a bill pay for {$200.00} and I had in there {$190.00} instead of them paying it then charge me the {$1.00} plus the fee, they would take the fee and then return it for insufficient funds and charge me again for another fee.

First of all I requested numerous times to send me final dispute status in writing to my email, they never sent it.

This falsification amounts to processing two charges by XXXX that were NOT authorized by XXXX but put through my account as Pending. 

XXXX then improperly assessed an overdraft fee which remained after those two charges were dropped. 

Almost a week later, after filing a complaint with you for the improper overdraft few- they NOW have processed those original two charges, never approved by XXXX -!! which XXXX will attest to. 

Putting through those two charges of {$180.00}. XXXX {$190.00}. XXXX Creating a NEGATIVE BALANCE IN MY ACCOUNT of {$370.00} -- -- -- Detailed explanation : As you know, two attempts were made to purchase XXXXXXXX XXXX  Neither transaction went through but both were debited against my XXXX debit. 

Those charges were always Pending and could never have cleared. 

In that time, Wells Fargo assessed an overdraft fee for a payment previously made because the two pending transactions created a negative balance. 

WF is not allowed to assess fees for Pending transactions. 

The two XXXX charges eventually dropped off but WF refused to remove the overdraft fee. 

I reported them to the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau and I emailed them stating that their activity had been reported. 

In response, they created a false statement that both of those XXXX charges cleared my account and were paid to you. 

I have asked XXXX XXXX, an executive at XXXX XXXX, for a written letter, stating that those two charges made through XXXX were never successfully processed and that they never received payment for them. 

This is not new behavior for Wells Fargo. 
In the past, I won a settlement against them for reordering my deposits and charges so that the withdrawal were seen to come before the deposits, artificially creating an overdraft. 

Fortunately, I had screenshots that proved they had reordered them after the fact. I believe they were also subject to a class action suit in another state for the same behavior. 

Please help me hold WF accountable for its ongoing criminal and corrupt behavior. 

This Wells Fargo direct deposit account and Visa Debit account is my account for XXXX XXXXXXXX payments. 

After twenty years as a professional health educator and patient advocate, I was forced to retire early on XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

In the forwarded emails below, you can see their attempt to create this new falsehood. 

Hello, In the few hours that it took to report additional misdeeds on the part of Wells Fargo, things have gone from bad to worse. 

In an attempt to cover their misdeeds - Wells Fargo has NOW processed those two transactions from XXXX so they can now claim that the overdraft fee was justified but my screenshots prove that this was processed after the fact.

In the fall ( XXXX ), we received a pre-settlement check ( twice ) for this class action that we DID NOT cash. We DID NOT accept the settlement amount. 
We have contracted Wellsfargo by phone and by email, and every time we are told that our inquiry is invalid, either because the lawsuit is for a specific issue, like them opening an account we didn't authorize, or that the lawsuit is closed and therefore we would not be included.

At this point, we feel that Wellsfargo is stalling and providing false information on purpose, and we are being stonewalled."
3/14/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"On XX/XX/2022 I had an appointment with a local Wells Fargo branch officer to discuss my grandmother 's accounts. I was with my mother, who was POA. I was alternate POA and am also an attorney. My grandmother had XXXX  XXXX and we were trying to make sure we understood what she had for accounts and how they were titled, so we would know what would need to be done upon her passing. We were advised her IRA was "" closed '' and had been rolled into a Retirement CD. We knew the IRA had designated beneficiaries but we were told those were no longer applicable and that the CD had no designated beneficiaries. We asked for paperwork so that the account holder, who was still of sound mind, could designate beneficiaries. We were told the branch doesn't have that paperwork and we'd need to call the IRA department to get that paperwork. We were told that the only way to get the CD after death without new beneficiaries would be either an estate or a 40-day death affidavit. After leaving the branch I called the IRA department we were instructed to call and was told they would not send out new beneficiary paperwork but we could get it from the branch. I explained that the branch just said the opposite and the man insisted he would not send out any new paperwork. 
My grandmother passed away in XXXX and death notification was uploaded via Wells Fargo 's website on XX/XX/XXXX. After 40 days I submitted the 40 day death affidavit. At that time, my mother and my aunt received beneficiary paperwork in the mail, which indicated the original IRA was the account that was open and they were the designated beneficiaries of that IRA. 
Nobody at Wells Fargo seems to have an explanation as to why we were told that IRA was closed and there were no designated beneficiaries, and nobody seems to have an explanation as to why the beneficiary paperwork was not sent in XXXX after death notification was provided to Wells Fargo, but instead we had to submit an unnecessary 40 day death affidavit. The representative that I spoke with today from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, was rude and said someone must have "" dropped the ball '' but it's no big deal because it's being taken care of now. 
Wells Fargo is a perpetually difficult financial institution to deal with when it comes to estates and accessing assets of deceased individuals. This is just one glaring instance of being provided incorrect information and then being required to submit unnecessary paperwork because nobody there seems to ever know what is going on. Their "" what's the big deal '' attitude is incomprehensible. The account would have been distributed differently if being distributed according to the 40 day death affidavit vs. the designated beneficiaries. We now have to inform some family members that they are not going to be receiving a part of this account, after they were told we needed their information to provide with the 40 day death affidavit. The amount of time I have wasted dealing with their error is frustrating as well."
3/14/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Hello, In XXXX a check that was written to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX was duplicated and used to write fraudulent checks against my account. I had over {$6000.00} in checks that had been written against my account by digitally changing information on the duplicated check. I discovered what was occurring and called Wells Fargo who said they put a hard hold on my account. I opened a new account and closed the account associated with the checks that were being used fraudulently. I filed a police report as well. In XXXX I noticed that there was addition fraudulent activity and checks on my new account. I called Wells Fargo and they told me the checks from my old account were being cashed and transferred to my new account. They said that someone didn't turn off the check cashing option on the old account so I asked that they do that and then we put a hard hold on the new account to prevent further activity from occurring on that account. I filed claims for all the fraudulent items, 8 in total totaling over {$7500.00}. Then in XXXX I had two additional fraudulent checks with the old check number cashed against my new account that also had a hard hold on it. One was for {$2000.00} and one was for {$9800.00}. I filed claims for both of these items and was issued a refund on both on XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly after that I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo that said, due to a processing error they were going to take back the {$9800.00} and they did on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to them again and they indicated that the claim was denied because they determined the check wasn't fraudulent. The check was written to the XXXX XXXX XXXX for laptops. This company doesn't seem to exist from what I can find. I have also never been able to see the image of this check online or the check number. I reopened the claim and it was closed again indicating it wasn't fraudulent. Throughout this process no one contacted me to talk to me about the claim even though I was promised multiple times that someone would call me. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to try to escalate the issue. They said there was nothing they could do. I asked to have an image of the check as well as the background on the research they did. I was assured I would be sent that. We don't currently even have a checkbook that has that check number in it. After I didn't receive the documentation, I called again 34 days later and was told it was in process. I just received a packet of "" research '' and it doesn't contain the check image or any other information. It is just a printed statement of my accounts. I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for 24 years and this situation has been absolutely awful. I have talked to them 13 times for over 6 hours regarding this issue and they are still denying this claim. There was clearly very little due diligence in determining if the check was fraudulent and I find it very odd that I can see the image and check number of every check I have ever written with Wells Fargo except this one. My check image was stolen by either someone at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or by someone at Wells Fargo."
3/14/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue that I have been facing with Wells Fargo Bank. I have been a customer of the bank for several years now, and I have always been satisfied with their services. However, this recent experience has left me extremely disappointed and frustrated. 
All started when I met XXXX XXXX on a website for dating couples. He then informed me he would be leaving XXXX for a job in XXXX. He gained my trust in lots of different ways. He left XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX. This is when the issues started. He had me log into his bank account and wire money from his account to other businesses. I logged on and wire transferred {$270000.00} for material to be delivered to XXXX. That Transfer went through perfectly. 
Then when I went to transfer {$28000.00} for the XXXX to have goods flown to XXXX his account froze. He then told me the next day that he would have to go back to XXXX to unfreeze his account. He was not able to do this ; he was stuck on the platform until job was completed. I saw he had over XXXX XXXX dollars in his account so I was certain I would get my money back. He first asked me to wire money on XX/XX/XXXX {$37000.00} to XXXX XXXX, a broker. I went to Wells Fargo Bank and wired the money. I did not have any issues wiring money at that time. 
The second time he asked to wire money was on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX was the broker for this one. HE explained something was broken and he needed to get the parts replaced and this was the cost of replacement. He asked that I say the purpose for payment was family support. As was the first wire transfer as well. He then kept getting issues out on the platform and would continue to need money. The next time was on XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a check {$72000.00} to a home in Florida his name was XXXX XXXX. I can provide his address. 
I used XXXX to send it overnight. The next time was a cashier 's check to XXXX XXXX, a Wells Fargo account for {$75000.00} Then XXXX XXXX {$57000.00} XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX {$30000.00} went to XXXX XXXX. This person has told me that by investing a big amount of money i could make very good profits, and has guaranteed me that at any point of time that i want to take my money back they would make it possible, so due to my lack of experience and knowledge i could think only that he was right and he knows what he was talking about, he sounded very confident and professional that i didnt think not even for a second that he was nothing but a scammer... I was naive and I trusted him so I sent all of my money. After trying to withdraw my money several times with no success, I understood that I made the mistake of my life and that I fell victim to a SCAM. 
I approached Wells Fargo multiple times to request a refund and to take necessary measures to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. I expected the bank to take their responsibilities seriously, but to my disappointment, they refused to take any responsibility and neglected their duties as a regulated financial institution. 
According to the terms and conditions of the bank, they are obliged to monitor suspicious transactions and ensure the safety of their clients ' funds. However, in this case, they have failed to do so. They even went as far as to blame me for the loss, stating that it was my fault and that they are not responsible. I find this unacceptable, and I believe that the bank has a moral and legal obligation to compensate me for my loss. 
I have attached copies of the letters that were sent to Wells Fargo. I kindly request your intervention in this matter and take necessary actions to ensure that justice is served. 
I would like to emphasise that I have always been a responsible and cautious customer. I have never engaged in any suspicious or illegal activities, and I have always followed the terms and conditions of the bank. I believe that I am entitled to a fair compensation for my loss, and I hope that you will take my case seriously and resolve it in a timely manner"

I was asked what statements did I need and I need all of them for the entire 3 1/2 year. That I banked with them. I also need to be able to search my XXXX  history and I need XXXX searches done. There is an exhaustive amount of information that I have been blocked from that. I had legal right to access and I have been trying to get this cleared for months. Please help me I cant qualify for a loan without this documentation. This type of retributive action should not be excepted. After months, they finally refunded my money from the prior claim but my punishment would be immediate closure of my account, and no access to my banking history records that is not lawful."
3/15/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I was paid ahead on my mortgage due to bi-weely payments. I was about to have a reduction in my child support so I called Wells Fargo to seek a loan modification on my mortgage, thinking the possible reduction in my mortgage would make my finances easier to manage. I was instucted at that time to stop paying my mortgage and fall three months behind because that was the only way I could apply for a loan modifcation. Once I fell three months behind, which took about six months because I was paid ahead, I reached out to WF bank and they took an application for a loan modification. They kept requesting the same documents over and over and strung the process out even though I was being assisted by a loan modification agency on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We did everything they asked us to and sent all documents. Wells Fargo and the assting agency assured me that as long as I was in loan modification status my home could not be foreclosed on. They never approved my loan modification and continuously requested documents previously submitted multiple times by the agency and myself that were sent to them. A friend called me one day and informed me my home was on a foreclosure list. When I called WF to inquire about the foreclosure info they assured me I was not. But then the letters started to come from their attorney and the harrassment began. WF denied that the foreclosure process was valid. They instructed me to ignore the letters from the attorney as they had me in loan modification status and I was fine. But the letters kept coming and they reported they would reach out to the attorney and they had the final say over all foreclosures. Through the process of the foreclosure it was discovered that Wells Fargo was only my loan servicer and NOT my lender, when asked to reveal the lender, they could not and on 3 seperate occasions provided 3 different alleged lenders to include a warehouse but Never themselves. When I requested to have the courts review my note, WF attorney said they had it in a vault in their office. I asked the judge to make them present it to see who I owed and she did not. I later found forged documents in my paperwork and robo signed documents by XXXX XXXXXXXX  In spite of all of this being clearly brought to the judges attention she ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  allowed my loan servicer to take my {$120000.00} home with no loss to them ever being verified.

3/15/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo 's websites are chronically, for many months, unable to accept electronic payments, nor to establish autopayments, nor to reliably maintain autopayments, resulting in them harvesting additional and unjustifiable late fees. While all banks have occasional technical outages, I believe that Wells shows a pattern of deliberate negligence in the operation of their websites, as this results in additional fee revenue when customers are unable to make payments quickly and conveniently. This pattern of behavior appears to me to be years-long. 

As just the latest example : XXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX, when attempting to make a one-time payment at XXXX XXXX, the website says "" We are unable to process this request at this time. Please try again later or call XXXX ''. This is certainly not a time in which Wells would be performing routine maintenance on the website. 

This is a recurring pattern since at least XXXX XXXX. At that time, I needed to change the bank accounts from which I make my mortgage payments to Wells Fargo. So, I cancelled my existing autopay order, and attempted to make a new one. The website was unable/unwilling to accept a new one at that time, so I was forced to make a 1-time payment. I then made multiple followup attempts to restore auto-payment, at which times the system was also unavailable. 

I believe that I eventually successfully created an autopay on my account, but of course did not document this activity, never expecting it to be a problem months later. My XXXX mortgage payment shows in my banking records as an 'autopay ' from Wells Fargo . If it was not actually an autopay, it was the second month in a row where I was forced to make manual payment, but I do not believe this to be the case. I know that I closed a documented To-Do about re-establishing autopay, believing it to be finished. However, no subsequent monthly payments were made, resulting in a late fee. 

Today, the website does allow creation of autopays again... but is unsurprisingly now unable to accept 1-time payments. This forced me to call and speak to a service agent to catch up my account, which many people will not find the time to do. There's always _something_ broken on the Wells Fargo website , something which will later generate unearned interest and late fees. 

Given Wells Fargo 's massive size and resources, and this being XXXX not XXXX, a service for reliable web mortgage payments is a trivial capability for a bank to operate. Wells Fargo 's failure to enable these payments reliably seems to fit into their long-term pattern of predatory, fee-seeking behavior, for which they have been repeatedly fined Billions of dollars. I would suggest that CFPB investigate how frequently and for what reasons WF 's digital payment systems have been offline, and how much interest and late fee revenue this has generated for WF."

I was informed by my case manager XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and an Executive Office Case Specialist XXXX XXXX case # XXXX in writing that my funds would go toward the escrow storage and all I needed to do is make up the difference for the trial period as the end all funds would be applied appropriately, and my payment would be under {$880.00}. I filed a complaint with CFPB Wells Fargo sent in the following response below : Thank you for the opportunity to address the concerns about the trial plan payments and final modification figures. We've reviewed your concerns and are providing you with details about our findings. The escrow shortage payment made in XX/XX/XXXX was applied to escrow as intended. The trial plan payments were required to be made in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We found you were given inaccurate information during the XXXX conversations you had with our home preservation team in XX/XX/XXXX. You were advised you didnt need to pay the XX/XX/XXXX and only a portion of the XX/XX/XXXX trial payment. We apologize for the misinformation you were given and have remediated the account in the amount of {$1600.00} so that we can issue new modification documents to properly adjust the account as you had intended and what you were told would happen. Here are important account details we'd like you to know. We will be applying the {$1600.00} as trial payments and will be drafting new modification documents. You may be required to make a XX/XX/XXXX payment. We will monitor this until the new documents get released. I'm glad we spoke about your concerns. I appreciate the opportunity to help you, and I've attached a copy of our response letter. 

Wells Fargo stated they would Draft new Documents but sent the same exact documentation with a different date, now I am being told they are not changing the amount of and are allowed to ask for additional amounts for a cushion on in my escrow which is inaccurate information."

3/15/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Hello, This complaint is in regards a XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card issued by Wells Fargo Bank. I live in Maryland and I did open this card, this is my account. I opened the card with the anticipation that I MIGHT purchase furniture in the next few months. I received the new card in the mail and everything was fine. Sometimes in XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo portal to pay a different credit card a Wells Fargo visa card and I noticed that the XXXX XXXX XXXX Card had a balance of {$3500.00}. I was shocked because it states on the statement the card was used to make the purchase in XXXX XXXX, CA. And again I live in Maryland not California. As soon as I noticed the balance I called Wells Fargo and reported the purchase as fraudulent. I was told the charges would be investigated. Now common sense tells me that Wells Fargo would have seriously looked into this matter from a common sense point of view. This is not like a simple fraud case where someone used a credit card to buy a laptop or TV. Whoever used my card purchased thousands of dollars in furniture. Furniture is obviously huge and I thought well this investigation will be simple. They will see I live in MD and not CA. And since its furniture they surely MUST have a delivery address for the furniture or signatures on file etc. I know for SURE they did not ID whoever used my account because I have never lost my ID before. I know to a bank like Wells Fargo {$3500.00} is not worth their time to investigate. But this is furniture and there has to be several things they could look into such as store camera footage, who picked up the furniture or where was it delivered to? Did the salesperson ask for ID from whoever was making purchases on my account? Are there any forms with signatures from the person who used my account? Surprisingly and shocked on XX/XX/2023 I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that they have completed their research and determined that I made the purchases, this just goes to show that nothing was really looked into and this concerns me because if there are people who are fraud victims and banks dont have adequate security to prevent purchases like this from happening to begin with then what are they even researching? What did the research show? I ask this because if someone like me who lives in Maryland and my account is being used in California at a furniture store then I dont know what protocols they have in place to prevent fraud for their customers. I have attached statements from Wells Fargo and the letter they sent me stating that the charges were made by me or someone I knew when the charges were indeed made by someone who is using others identities. Id appreciate if you can look into this matter for me. Due to this I cant trust the Wells Fargo security measures. Usually when it comes to a store credit card you need to enter your SS # on the kiosk pad the cashier will swipe or scan your ID.. Did the cashier/salesperson even do this much? I have decided to close my other cards with Wells Fargo due to this issue.

In early XXXX of 2023, I was contacted by a business through a freelance hiring site. This individual asked me to create some digital illustrations for them, and they would pay me {$600.00} for each illustration. There was to be 8 illustrations total, for a total cost of {$4800.00}. This individual also explained there would be 4 more illustrations after this job that would need to be completed for {$2400.00}, but that it would be at a later date and we would come back to it. They explained that they were working with a sponsor, who would be paying the bill, and the funds were ready to be sent while the project commenced. Shortly after, I received a cashiers check for {$7200.00}, which I deposited into my wells fargo account. This individual explained that they had accidently sent me the full amount of the project, and since we had signed a contract for {$4800.00} they asked if I could kindly return the difference of {$2400.00}. I agreed, as this person seemed legit at the time, and we had been conversing back and forth for the better part of a week. I used paypal to transfer the {$2400.00} funds, which pulled money from my wells fargo account. This type of transaction usually takes 12-24 hours. Once the transfer was initiated, I contacted the person to let them know the money was on the way. At this point, the individual suddenly changed tone, and I was told they needed the remaining funds immediately to cover an emergency that had just occurred. This change was very sudden and alarming, and immediately started to feel like a scam. I immediately contacted paypal and wells fargo separately, asking them to freeze the transaction, freeze my accounts, and to stop all money leaving both accounts. XXXX told me they were not able to stop the transfer because of the type of transfer I used ( friends and family ) and wells fargo told me they would not freeze my account. I contacted multiple people, various times, to attempt to stop this transfer. No one would help me at either institution, no one would freeze my account, and I was basically told "" too bad ''. I continued to try to stop this transfer for the next 24 hours until the transfer was processed. At this time, the cashiers check also bounced, and so the amount of {$7200.00} was withdrawn from my wells fargo account. I contacted wells fargo again to explain what happened, and they opened a charge dispute. However, they did not take any information about the situation, nor did they ask what had happened or how it occurred, they simply just opened a dispute claim. The claim was denied within 2 weeks. I have been repeatedly calling paypal and wells fargo to attempt to get help in retrieving my funds, but at this point I have been denied across the board and no one will help me.

They were nice in helping me but they had to call their corporate offices to see what could be done. We qualified for disaster relief due to all the wildfires in our area. However ; it impacted the loan terms because we were not able to make the payments. It ended up adding a ton at the end of our term and the original interest-rate that they gave us was already a ridiculous amount. Long story short we ended up refinancing with a different bank to get our from under their ridiculous rates/terms.

The back is yet to tell me who it went to, what account/bank or name. No Information has been provided to me & Im being told Ill never get my money back. Agents are hanging up on me whenever I call. Im seeing the money being transferred out but I dont know the person & never authorized this transfer. If my card didnt declineI wouldnt know my money is gone. When I checked my account after trying to do a purchase I saw these large transactions. Im battling identity theft now my money starts disappearing."
3/16/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,Hi I had a Wells Fargo account an I would have money inside of my savings. I would transfer the exact amount of money from my savings every time I made a purchase. But when I look up Wells Fargo would charge my card for the purchase and then a couple days later my account would go negative. It got to the point they overcharged my cart {$200.00} and I was in the negative.
3/16/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with fees charged,I have a Wells Fargo auto loan that Ive had since XX/XX/XXXX I contacted them today cause I notice they have been charging and tacking on XXXX dollars and some change every month to my car loan payment I spoke to representative asking why are they charging a late fee for XX/XX/XXXX if the date hasnt even got here and they are already charging me fees. Its no telling how many times they have done this in the past and I am just now noticing.
3/16/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"When I did have that account, I had a high interest rate which made no sense because at the time my credit score was fine enough to have a lower interest-rate so that means I had to pay more for my vehicle than I should have. I called the company and ask them if they could do anything and they told me that there is nothing that they can do, so I was forced to pay off my loan about a year later Im highly disappointed"
3/16/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"During XXXX or XXXX, I fell behind on loan payments with Wells Fargo due to a change in jobs and having to work out of state. I went through many people trying to modify the loan and was basically denied the modification of lowering the interest rate and ended up having to pay a {$10000.00} payment to Wells Fargo. I still own this home but wanted to see if I am eligible for any of the settlement funds."
3/16/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with fees charged,"I want to ensure I was not overcharged with my Wells Fargo auto, mortgage or checking/savings accounts between XXXX. I recently found out that Wells Fargo was liable for incorrect interest rates and overdraft fees during this time and was paying customers back for any overages. I'd like to know if I was impacted by these errors."
3/16/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/2023 I was subject to fraud when I received a text message that was very similar to previous fraud alert texts from Wells Fargo, stating that someone was trying to XXXX {$3500.00} from my account and asking if it was me. I called the phone number provided and the scammer said everything the same way a Wells Fargo customer service representative would have ( I would know as my debit card was compromised and needed to be cancelled and I was sent a new one a few weeks prior to this ). 
The scammer was able to obtain my information well enough to process a XXXX transaction of {$3500.00} to be withdrawn from my personal checking account. It was not until the call dropped and I tried to call back without success that I realized I had been scammed. 
I then immediately called Wells Fargo and presented to the nearest branch to discuss the issue. The XXXX withdraw was already processed and the {$3500.00} was removed from my account. I was given a investigation claim number, and was told my account needed to be closed and that I would need to reopen a new one, which I did. I was then told it would take 7-10 business days for me to hear a decision from their investigation. 
I received a letter in the mail dated from XX/XX/2023. This letter was sent no more than 2 business days after my claim was filed ( XX/XX/XXXX was a bank holiday ). The letter stated that the investigation was complete, "" the transaction was made through a secure online banking session by you or someone who had your authority and no other processing errors occurred. Based on this information, we determined the transaction was authorized. We have closed your claim ''. 
This transaction was NOT authorized, and the company did not even have the decency to open up the conversation further or offer a way to appeal their decision. I know other companies such as XXXX will assess the IP address the "" secure online banking session '' occurred from in order to investigate whether it is even anywhere near me, I doubt they did this. 
I have been a customer of Wells Fargo and XXXX for many years. I am now in further debt thanks to their unwillingness to help. I am a small business owner and can not afford events like this. There is a statement made by the CFPB that states if a consumer is fraudulently induced by a third party into sharing account access information that the consumer should receive the same protections as if the money were acquired from a stolen debit card or other banking access device, but apparently Wells Fargo and XXXX do not see it this way."

3/16/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"My home was foreclosed in XX/XX/XXXX, due to loan modification not being approved. My complaint is this : I should be a part the settlement that occured on XX/XX/XXXX, due to improper modification standards, but I have not been notified by Wells Fargo. In fact, when I contacted Wells Fargo recently, they have no record of my mortgage from XXXX to XXXX. I had a financial hardship and entered into the loan modification program during XXXX, and entered the loan modification program XXXX separate times, unfortunately, nobody ever spoke to me, I only received denial reasons, unexplained. This clearly appeared to be a staffing or volume issue that Wells Fargo do not have a handle on, and I should be included in the wrongful foreclosure, as nobody investigated my loan modifications, and of course, now there is no record. I can provide statements if needed."
3/16/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,Our home was financed through Wells Fargo in 2011 and several charges were accessed to our account including sell our account to a third party. We have since sold the home and no longer have an account with Wells Fargo.
3/16/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/24, I received a call from the Wells Fargo fraud department telling me they were verifying a {$110.00} charge on my debit card. I never use this card for purchases and I said it was a bad charge. I provided info on my debit card, including number and pin. This turned out to be a scam but I didn't realize it. The next morning, I checked my account to be sure the {$110.00} was not there, only to find a charge in XXXX for {$2500.00}. I called the WF fraud dept immediately. They provided a provisional credit. They now are saying it is a permanently closed claim and I am responsible for the money because I provided the acct # and pin. 

Obviously, this was a terrible mistake which I realized after the fact. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX widow, have never made a purchase on this card, and have not informed WF of being out of the country, have never been to XXXX and know no one there. This charge should have been picked up initially with a phone call verifying a large charge on a card that I have owned for years and never used except as an ATM transaction. 

Their regs indicate that I have zero liability if there is stolen activity for unauthorized transactions. The account info was stolen in a scam call and I never authorized the use of my account. The letter from WF ( included as an attachment ) indicates the charge was made by me or someone who had my permission, patently false. 

WF has said they will not re-open the case. I need your help to resolve this situation where I, a consumer was scammed, and the bank is calling the result of the scam an authorized transaction."
3/16/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"I brought XXXX XXXX XXXX  and in XXXX  with Well Fargo Bank and the interest rate was very high and did try to refinance though they denied me. I have been paying the loan for six years. In XXXX XXXX the car was stolen in a park n ride in XXXX XXXX, Washington. I am working with my insurance to see if the car is fixable or if they will pay it off. But Well Fargo decided to change off the car before the insurance finished the process. Well Fargo Representative told me on the phone they will unstill my insurance process. After a few days I received a call from Well Fargo and the representative said that my car was charged off which will impact my credit now. Well Fargo reported that I was late on the payment which was not true."
3/16/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Confusing or missing disclosures,"I got an offer from Wells Fargo for a {$300.00} bonus for opening a checking account and meeting certain requirements with a XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I opened the account online using the website wellsfargo.com/XXXX which was specified. However, they did not prompt me for the Promo Code and instead applied a different promo Code XXXX. 

I completed the process, and downloaded the BONUS DISCLOSURE ( see attached ), but nowhere on the 2 page document does it mention the amount of {$300.00} as the bonus I will get if I meet all the requirements. 

I went to a branch, and was told I need to call their toll free number since account was opened online. 

I just finished the phone call, and the person would not send me an email confirming that the amount of bonus I will get is as {$300.00}. She said I will know it when I get it, which is four months away. Given Wells Fargo previous frauds, how can we consumers trust them to do so, when they refuse to put the bonus amount in writing."
3/16/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"After a long drawn our process taking hundreds of hours on the phone, Wells Fargo messing up multiple times all of my claims were settled with many denied. One claim that one denied was a wire transfer for the amount of {$1000.00} because it was too long ago. Although they could credit other fraudulent charges that were older they could not refund this. 
Wells Fargo messed up so bad that they blamed the computer for missing transactions that I had disputed so they had to listen to the phone calls. These were some of the missing claims, they were denied. 
There were multiple transactions that were missing from claim XXXX on the XXXX XXXX  ending in XXXX that were requested to be researched. The debit card ending in XXXX was used for 4 unauthorized XXXX transactions of {$20.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$87.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$43.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$1700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. For these transactions claim XXXX was filed. 

This claim was denied because Wells Fargo saw me transfer an unknown amount of money in my accounts so I must have known. I have a letter from XXXX stating that I did not have an account with them. Wells Fargo says to work with XXXX yet XXXX has no record of me. How could any transaction that took place using a XXXX account that I never had, not be fraudulent. Wells Fargos statement even says they were unauthorized. To top it off one of the original investigators failed to pass along the id theft information so they hit me with dispute fraud, closed my accounts and I had no access to my statements. So I had to go to the local branch print out about a foot tall stack of paper transactions that werent even in chronological order. Up until Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I was told they were still working on the case, I still had hope. When I called to check the status they told me that they figured it out on the XXXX and it was just a computer error why I was receiving emails"

3/17/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a complaint against Wells Fargo for violating the Fair Credit Billing Act. Specifically, I believe that the credit card issuer re-applied a dispute on my credit card account after 60 days, which is in violation of the 60-day limit set forth by the XXXX Credit Billing Act. 

On XX/XX/2023 & XX/XX/2023, I made a purchase on my credit card with the above-mentioned credit card issuer. However, I discovered an error on my billing statement and immediately contacted the issuer to dispute the charge. After an investigation, the issuer removed the disputed charge from my account. 

However, I was surprised to find that the same charge was re-applied to my account after 60 days had passed. I believe that this is a violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act, as the dispute was initiated within the 60-day time frame.

I have attempted to resolve this issue with the credit card issuer, but have not been able to reach a satisfactory resolution. As a result, I am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter.

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request that you take appropriate action to ensure that the credit card issuer complies with the Fair Credit Billing Act. If you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

3/17/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"My father passed away in XXXX. He left the house to me, the only heir and beneficiary of the estate and the representative of the estate. We transfered the deed/title into our name immediately. 

We contacted Wells Fargo with all the information and waited. We informed them my dad passed and we were aware he was overdue on a home equity loan by XXXX. We had XXXX on hand and wanted to work to pay the other XXXX within 13 months. My dad had XXXX and that's why he was behind on the loan before he passed. They never offered my dad any assistance for having XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX. They say XXXX of the money is past due taxes which my father believed to be a lie. He only owed 4 years of past due taxes at XXXX per year. 

Over a period of months they kept requesting more documents, wasting our time until finally telling us that they could NOT even speak to us because my dad 's ex wife from 20 years ago was on the promissory note. I informed them that she was removed from the deed ages ago and that we are now the homeowners, meaning we have interest in the property. I sent them the new deed with my name on it. I sent them the probate paperwork showing my dad left the house to me. I showed them the divorce decree showing that his ex wife gave up the house in the divorce. I told them that we have no idea if XXXX is even in the country, alive or dead and have no way to contact her. 

They responded by saying none of that mattered. That they may not accept any payments made by us, they will not work with us and that they intend to forclosure on our home and there's nothing we can do about it with them. They made it sound like they dont want our money that they just want to profit from the forclosure. And they said they're protecting my dad 's ex wife by not allowing us to pay. If we worked out a deal with them it could do NOTHING but HELP my dad 's ex wife as she has no ownership of the property and no interest in it. The harm they have done is take our primary residence over XXXX because they can. They may be lying about the XXXX in back taxes and prevented us as the actual home owners from looking into it. It's criminal. Please help is. We live here and have XXXX children here and this house is all my dad had to pass down to his family. This is malicious in my opinion they have the discretion to work with us."

3/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"My Wells Fargo account was hacked which I made a call about and they told me that they would refund me. So I sent my irs check to that account cause I thought it was okay, they ended up taking XXXX $ out of my account when the check hit cause it was overdraft from the hack. It showed I had an available amount and I was only using my card cause that. They told me the irs check didnt hit till my account closed because the overdraft like 3 days later, even though it showed available. My card has never been able to access money without it being available. Even if so still an issue on their end, I should see an accurate number for availability on their app. So they closed my account took all of my irs check because they didnt solve the issue correctly and blamed me. They use my money to close the account without any warning or call and my account was fine the day before. I have called so many times and I also have went in and they keep putting the blaming on me for my account being hacked. I am a poor college student and Im trying to graduate right now, that money from irs was my only money I had and I cant afford to eat or buy anything I need. They wan na refund me XXXX $ for one of the overdraft when they should do all them cause they werent me.. this has caused me distress and anxiety and I feel like no one is advocating against this or for me and Wells Fargo was really unhelpful and unkind. When I went in the lady tried to scolded me about what Ive spent money on, it was unprofessional and she also was blaming me. Young people need to be listened to, too. I have no one else to come in with me and help and its really unfair and unfortunate that Wells Fargo thinks its okay to take advantage of me because Im young and my money. They also keep blaming me for the overdraft fees even though I called and they told me I must of talked to someone that was a scammer. Which I feel would mean I need more support by them, but they stole my money."

When I called Wells Fargo executive today to find out the pay off they gave me a incorrect amount and didnt deduct the extra amount for Gap Ins and was told per XXXX that because car was charged off I may not get a refund or I may have to pay a penalty which was incorrect & was told from Gap that was not true. They are a separate company which is my choice to pay this additional amount. I cancel my Gap ins and immediately contacted XXXX who was now very nice and apologized for being told this was mandatory. She will further investigate this matter that was not handled properly and how dare them treat me this way especially because Im on XXXX and live on a fixed income which I told XXXX XXXX but cant afford Any additional fees not necessary which is proof this policy was not needed and was an option but according to the finance dep it was necessary in order, to secure my car loan."

They would charge me ATM fees even when I could receive funds cause they froze my account. I would connect my card to XXXX and they even said that they had returned over {$2500.00} back to me that should be in my account within 1-3 days. But when I talk to Wells Fargo they said transactions was denied and never taken out of account but my account kept decreasing. Out of the money I had in my account i used only {$6200.00} of my money. The rest of my money is gone and they claimed I used it when I didnt have access to my account at all. And now my account is in the negative. Over {$6000.00} is missing from my account and they are denying any wrong doing. They had multiple withdrawals that I didnt make and transactions reversals that was never returned to my account.

3/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"XX/XX/2023 To whom it may concern : My name is XXXX XXXX and I want to make a formal complaint against Wells Fargo Bank for fraud and bad business practices. 

On XX/XX/2023 my partner wrote a check to me in the amount of {$1200.00} so we could pay our mortgage. I mobile deposited it into my checking account ending in XXXX. That evening I received a confirmation email from Wells Fargo Bank confirming the deposit and stating that {$400.00} of the check would be available right away and the remaining {$850.00} would be available XX/XX/2023. ( I will enclose a pic of the email ). 
With that on XXXX XX/XX/2023 I paid our mortgage online to my carrier. When I got home from work that evening of XX/XX/2023 I noticed that the deposit of {$1200.00} was not showing in my account. My partner immediately called his bank and was questioning if they had released the funds for deposit into my account. 
Meanwhile I called Wells Fargo and was questioning why the funds were there and now they were not credited? First, they tried telling me that the funds were not released by my partners bank, at which time they were shot down because we were on the phone with his bank and Wells Fargo at the same time. At this time the operator whom I was speaking with told me there was nothing she could do. So, I asked for a supervisor. 
I was transferred to XXXX knows who. So, this person says to me that the funds are being held. HELD? The excuse they determined was that there was a discrepancy in the signature. I replied by saying both sides of the check were signed how could there be a discrepancy and whom determines if there is a discrepancy in his signature???? They replied it was done by the computer! WHAT?? 
They proceeded to tell me that the funds that deposited would not be available until XX/XX/2023. I had already sent my mortgage payment and there would not be enough funds to cover this transaction without his deposit money. Needless to say I hung up on them. 
The next morning I was on the phone again with WF the first operator I got sounded like they just woke up or was on XXXX. So I asked to speak to his supervisor. The next person gave me the same lame excuse and gave me a case number ( XXXX ) and that it was going to be reported to the escalation department. 
I then received yet another WF email that stated We credited the deposit to your account, but some or all of the with not be available for your immediate use. NO funds were ever credited to my account. 
This is fraud! And very bad business practice. My partner deposited a check from the same bank with the same signature into our WF business account on XX/XX/2023 and it was available the next day???? I am more than furious! I want to be reimbursed for any and all fees associated with fraudulent transaction, I also want interest on those monies that WF bank is holding for NO reason. I need them to be held responsible and accountable for their actions. I and my entire family will also be pulling our accounts from this institution. 
Please advise as to next steps, Thank you in advance,"

He told me I had some suspicious activity on my account. He called from a number that is the common number called for Wells Fargo assistance. He asked me if I was in XXXX because that is where the suspicious activity was taking place. I told him NO. He asked me to authenticate my identity through sending texts and providing the code back to them just like Wells Customer Service requested from me the next day. He then said they were attempting to wire money out of the account. He put me on hold a number of times and then told me the wire had gone through. He said he was escalating it and it would be resolved and returned to me in 24 hours. At no time did I provide him any confidential information. He did ask if the last 4 of my SS XXXX was XXXX but I never volunteered any information nor provided my username or password. When I called WF the following day they had no record of the 'fraud '. When I reported it to WF fraud they took my info and said I would hear something in a week or so and also said there was a 95+ % chance the money would be returned to me. When I did call on Friday XX/XX/XXXX I was told that they traced it to a bank and the money was not there so the case was closed. Shocked! I asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to a 'Spencer ' and was met with a very brief response. We did not recover the money from the bank it was traced too and the case is now closed. We see that it came from your username so we can not return any funds because it appears you initiated it. I did not. 

Being a XXXX XXXX customer I think this was handled very poorly. I was never asked by anyone from WF to provide any specific details of the incident. There was no 'personal "" communication at all. It was all basic questions and then days go by and was basically told. Sorry we did not find the money. I lost nearly {$25000.00} and was treated as if it was pennies. No explanations. No education. Nothing. My goal is to recover what was mine. It can not be that easy to remove a customer 's money from a highly secure institution. The customer can not be treated last! 

I have been told the case is closed because I authorized the transfer. I did not! but the customer is always last."

The notification of the clearing of the deposit stated the funds would be available on XX/XX/23. On XX/XX/23 in the early morning hours, a balance notification was sent to me showing a positive and accurate amount of available funds in my checking account. I then received a notification on XX/XX/23 at XXXX that these cleared and posted funds were forced into a second deposit hold, even though the funds were cleared and posted by the Dealerships bank and my bank. The second deposit hold reason is "" Signature On Check Was Irregular, '' but after verifying with Wells Fargo that this occurred on their end, not the Dealership 's bank 's side, I have not received satisfactory information on how the signature was determined to be irregular, when the woman at the Dealership who wrote the check has had no prior business with Wells Fargo -- how does Wells Fargo even know what her signature looks like? I have repeatedly called, escalated, and made it a point to inform Wells Fargo that they are duplicated check verification steps for a check already cleared and posted.

Tried to find out why I couldnt receive the title and got a run around and never could receive it. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX I called again to find out how to get the title because nc wildlife stated there is a lien from Wells Fargo bank still on the title so I called the bank and I was told they will send a notarized lien release and I would receive it in 7 days I waited 3 weeks then I called back they told me it was not approved and they where going to send one out again this happened 3 times now. I also was told by numerous supervisors they would reach out to me about the issue and they never have. Its now XX/XX/XXXX and I still can not get answers about receiving a notarized lien release no one is reaching out as they said they would after I sent documentation showing that they indeed have a lien still on the title. I need the title and Wells Fargo has just been giving the run around and every time I call to get an update I have to explain the entire story over and over and start from step one again due to speaking to someone different every time because they can not give me a direct line so I can talk to the same supervisors or other employees that I talked to before about the issue and that know whats all going on and the issues Ive been having.
3/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I have received direct deposit from my job every XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  EST for the past couple of months ( it used to be XXXX but that changed around XX/XX/XXXX ). My Wells Fargo checking account was overdrawn {$88.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and I was notified at XXXX XXXX EST, that morning. I get paid at XXXX XXXX EST every XXXX, so I knew my direct deposit would post and clear because it always does. Upon me getting off of work at XXXX XXXX EST ( XXXX XXXX  ), I open my Wells Fargo checking account and my direct deposit was posted and AVAILABLE and the overdraft I fees I incurred were cleared. I went ahead and paid my bills. After I paid them, and before I went into my work building at XXXXXXXX XXXX EST XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), I looked at my Wells Fargo checking account and there was an available balance of {$160.00}. When I got off of work the following morning at XXXX XXXX EST ( XX/XX/XXXX, Friday ) I opened my Wells Fargo banking app and my account was - {$60.00}. I knew this couldnt be right so I checked my past activity on the account. It was suddenly saying my direct deposit had just posted that morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and not XX/XX/XXXX like had been shown originally. I called Wells Fargo customer service twice and was met with rudeness and no resolution. Wells Fargo is saying that the payment did just post on XX/XX/XXXX and my account had been negative since that XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I had been sent a notification email that my account was negative XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX EST, which I did see. However for every time I overdrafted my account from that point, I never received a notification, no email nothing since XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and it has been two days since the last time I was made aware my Wells Fargo account was overdrafted. Now Im not sure if anybody else has Wells Fargo, but usually you receive an email with all the information of the payments withdrawn. I did not receive one until after I got off the phone with customer service the first time on XX/XX/XXXX and pointed out that something wasnt adding up. Then they said I was a part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX but the company had not posted it andit just did not make sense. I feel that Wells Fargo is definitely doing something fraudulent and are just giving people the run around while taking their money."

3/17/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo had been miss-paying our property taxes, and have now taken action to charge us a second time for the taxes and negatively affected our credit score. We found out on XX/XX/XXXX that the XXXX tax office had sold our home in a tax sale due to almost XXXX  years of unpaid property taxes. We have an escrow account as required by our refi with Wells Fargo ( WF ) and WF paid taxes. We had escrow statements showing taxes were paid, but DC said none had been paid, and complicating matters XXXX govt had the wrong mailing address for us. We contacted WF, who immediately blamed XXXX. I spent weeks trying to determine what had happened and ensure we still had our home. We have never made a late payment, and WF had been sending us Escrow adjustments and collecting money from us to pay taxes. 

After XXXX weeks of desperate calls finally WF told me they had made the error. That when they originated the payment account they made a typo. They said they would pay the back taxes and the current taxes and cover all penalties and issues. They never sent me any documentation when I asked for it. I am still waiting on a letter they claim to have mailed on XX/XX/XXXX that was a form letter stating a tax sale was averted. They finally provided to me via email on XX/XX/XXXX when I called to ask for a status update. I was told they had made payments to avert the tax sale and would work to collect the money from our escrow that had been payed to the wrong property. 

XXXX days ago I got an alert from my credit monitoring that WF has raised the principle balance on my mortgage. They had added an "" Advance '' payment in an amount exceeding {$11000.00} to our account. No letter or call or any other notice had been given. This was flagged to me by another bank because it lowered my credit score enough it was pushing me from XXXX to XXXX. My husband 's score was also lowered. 

I called WF and from what I understand they "" Advanced '' against my account the tax amount that should have been paid from my escrow for past years taxes. Instead. In essence they have charged me twice for taxes we already paid into escrow but that their error paid to the wrong property. We had already paid that money via the escrow account. I was told that as they try to recoup the money they applied the advance which raised the principle and reported that my principle balance has gone up triggering detrimental effects on my credit score. They said they assumed the advance would go down as they recoup the money -- again money they paid in error and we did not control -- but that does not mean my score will go up. I was told they could do nothing and they would not remove the "" advance ''. 

We did nothing wrong. We paid the money WF told us to pay, we reviewed our escrow documents, and apparently had been receiving at best inaccurate or at worse fraudulent escrow statements. Making matters worse only shared updated tax pay out information and any details only today after I demanded information. I had to find out about these changes from another bank. I was promised updates and returned calles from WF that never happened. I had to spend hours on the phone to get information and much of that information was inaccurate. I had to use my vacation time to make calls because WF was so bad at responding and giving my information, but I took that time because I did not want to lose my home over their mismanagement and I did not want my credit score to tank because of their mistakes. 

My family was hoping to move, but now both my husband and I have lower credit scores. We spent weeks afraid we were losing out home after doing everything right, and now we will have worse rates all due to WF mismanagement and mistakes."

I reached out to the company who states I am a risk. I demanded an explanation. The male stated that they did not have to get me a reason. The credit limit reduction affect our credit and looks as if we spending all the funds on the credit card.

I signed up for the class action against Wells Fargo some time ago, but I have not heard from anyone regarding the settlement which was reached. Wells Fargo held back my deposits until after they would present withdrawals to my account even if I deposited cash at the bank at opening time, by midnight they would charge my account all the withrawals & overdraft fees, and then post my deposits AFTERWARDS. This made my account go into a negative balance each time they did this, thus causing many presentments to my account to be charged or returned as NSF causing mer to incur charges to the persons I wrote the check to. 
This caused me to receive countless overdraft fees well in excess of {$1500.00}. 

I would like to receive my compensation for their fradulent behavior. It created undue hardship for me at the time. It was a very serious problem that I tried to work out with them directly back then, but it always fell on deaf ears.

3/17/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,In XXXX I originally signed documents with mortgage company and title company on my payments for home to be around XXXX per month a few years later Wells Fargo notifies me by letter stating they incorrectly calculated my Escrow and they had not been taxing the home only the property so they increased my mortgage payment to over XXXX dollars which was way over what I originally was told by mortgage company and surely something that was going to be un affordable. I have continued to have problems with them year after year. They should have never changed the amount to what I had originally signed for and I have had to go thru a modification several times because they made a mistake and have created so much stress with my mortgage. Increasing my payment to over XXXX dollars more a month is unacceptable on their part. I am appealing with Wells Fargo for a 3rd time. I am about XXXX dollars behind on payments a little over 6 mos.

See supporting documents included as part of this complaint. This complaint is NOT related with the merchant 's pricing and policies. Wells Fargo failed to comply with the following requirements : 1. Resolve the dispute within two billing cycles. 
The first Wells Fargo resolution letter for the dispute XXXX was sent on XX/XX/XXXX, after two fully billing cycles from my claim, which was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. The Fair Credit Billing Act establishes a period of not later than two complete billing cycles to resolve a dispute.

Refer to Fair Credit Billing Act sections 1666 ( a ) ( B ) and 1666 ( a ) ( B ) ( ii ). 

2. Resolve the dispute and send written explanation prior to taking any action to collect the amount. 
Wells Fargo re-billed the disputed amount on XX/XX/XXXX, three days before they sent me the resolution letter, which was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. According to the Fair Credit Billing Act, the creditor shall sent written explanation prior to taking any action to collect the amount. Refer to Fair Credit Billing Act sections 1666 ( a ) ( B ) and 1666 ( a ) ( B ) ( ii ). 

As explained in the Federal Trade Commission article, "" If an issuer doesnt follow the settlement procedure, they forfeit a portion ( up to {$50.00} ) of what theyre allowed to collect ( the disputed amount plus finance charges ), even if the bill turns out to be correct. '' Refer to Fair Credit Billing Act section 1666 ( e ). 

Wells Fargo can not rebilled me the disputed amount because they failed to comply with the requirements established in the Fair Credit Billing Act. Therefore, I request to Wells Fargo a full refund ( credit in my account ) of {$89.00} to my credit card."
3/18/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We've had Wells Fargo as our mortgage company for many years. In the beginning, we had money in escrow for our taxes. We had our mortgage go up every year and they kept saying it was the taxes going up. We refinanced maybe 15-20 years ago with them and found out that they paid our taxes at the end of the year, which made us incurre the late penalty. I told them this was not right to do since money was in escrow. They said this was their practice to do so. We refinanced and had them take out the taxes so we would pay them early. Our mortgage rate never went up because of taxes again. Was there any recourse for them to pay us back all those late fees on our taxes? As soon as we received the tax bill we mailed it in to them the next day or so."
3/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On the morning of Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved phone calls from scammers claiming they were my bank Wells Fargo and they eventually got access to my account and made two fraudulent transactions, one for {$350.00} and another for {$600.00}, as well as "" internatioanl purchase transaction fees '' of {$18.00} and {$10.00} respectively. Once I realized what happened, I immediately called Wells Fargo to let them know what had just happened. They seemed indifferent to my situation and addressed me with minimal help. I filed a formal fraud claim with them, which was quickly denied. I then started another fraud claim, which too, was denied. Upon asking the customer service rep on the phone why they were both denied, he told me that the bank "" didn't believe it was fraud '' based on their investigation. I am now left without my money, and no avenues to get my money back from whoever stole it that day. I am unable to contact the merchant on the transactions because it is overseas, and have minimal information about themselves."

3/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"My new checking account was closed right after I opened it. Wells fargo and XXXX XXXX refused to give me the reason. But I new the reason when XXXX XXXX purposely put herself at the bank while I was opening my new account. She falsely called them saying I harassed her while i was minding my own business and the banker i was working with knew i wasn't harassing XXXX XXXX. The police didn't do anything to me either. Wells fargo for XXXX years didn't put in writing that why my account was closed because I was harassing XXXX XXXX. She was harassing me falsely accusing me and she kept getting away with it. Wells fargo finally admitted after XXXX years were up that it was because I was harassing XXXX XXXX which is why my account was closed. I had the original opened for XXXX  year until XX/XX/2015 when I couldn't log in to my online account. I was being set up by XXXX XXXX to pull what she did. 

They need to find someone who isn't in cahoots with XXXX and XXXX XXXX to investigate my complaint. Because if they had looked at the footage of the security cameras. It would show the time XXXX XXXX walked in and the time i walked in. I had no idea at the time she was at the bank. She got away with falsely accusing me once before she was going to do it again. 

When the police didn't do anything. She whined to XXXX XXXX who wrote me a nasty and hostile letter with saying XXXX at the top of the letter stating that wells fargo was exercising their rights to close my account. I was only to call on the phone to conduct any business. This was a violation of my civil rights! XXXX XXXX refused to investigate the security footage that I wasn't bothering or harassing XXXX XXXX. It would show that I was minding my own business talking to the banker helping me. This was dirty and criminal. Then someone at wells fargo said they don't handle domestic issues. Well, XXXX XXXX brought the domestic issue to harass me in the bank to slander I and my son to influence wells fargo to close my account. 

A lawyer told me I can sue for millions for the mental distress and breach of contract for them wrongfully closing my account since this was at the bank where XXXX XXXX continued to harass me. That makes wells fargo responsible for the actions and misconduct that she committed against me. XXXX XXXX is not in charge of my life of what I can or can not have but she is being allowed to treat me like she did."

XXXX XXXX, I received 2 texts from Wells Fargo asking if I'd authorized a XXXX transaction for {$3500.00} to someone in XXXX. I responded NO. Got a text saying a Wells Fargo representative would contact me shortly. 

Received a call from someone who identified himself as XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo. I was at work at this time ( I work in a school setting and my students were unsupervised adding to my extreme stress ). During the call I expressed concern and he told me he was called from Wells Fargo Customer Service and that I should check the number he was called from - when I did it showed up as the Wells Fargo Customer Service number. He asked questions and led me through a series of steps to open a XXXX account so I could received this stolen money back. When I tried to ask questions he got impatient and stressed great urgency to complete this. He gave a case # XXXX and told me for security reasons not to access my account for 24-48 hours. 
I texted my husband at XXXX. He went directly to our local XXXX branch but didn't really know what had transpired due to my short text. He was told there shouldn't be a problem. I called him as soon as I was able at XXXX and told him what had happened. He went back to the bank and was told by a banker, XXXX XXXX, that I had been scammed. He told my husband to have me file a claim and he thought we'd be able to get the money back. 
As soon as I got home I filed the claim. 
I received a letter ( undated but received XX/XX/XXXX ) referencing our claim and saying there was nothing they could do since the funds had been transferred. I called XXXX as soon as I got home and talked to XXXX. I expressed that this wasn't handled to our satisfaction and asked who else I could talk to. She told there was no one else I could talk to but she would send me the documents that were used in making this decision. 
We received the documents on XX/XX/XXXX ( letter dated XXXX ). After studying the documents I was not able to understand one of them and the quality was too poor to read clearly, so on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX I called XXXX seeking clarification. XXXX was unable to answer my questions, she did not have a copy of what was sent to me, and I was not able to talk to the person who prepared the documents. I also asked about the possibility of an appeal and she said no. My question was regarding a XXXX  Modification History with the same XXXX as was used in my scam. Since I couldn't read this portion, I wanted to know if it was included because this individual had scammed others. The answer I go was WellsFargo won't say if this person has done this before, that XXXX asks the other bank to return that money and if they don't that's all they can do. 
I realize they are claiming I initiated this transaction, but I did so under duress. Also, I have never had a XXXX account and I think they should have questioned the transaction due to that fact and the large amount. I also feel the documentation provided was inadequate, and without being able to discuss it with anyone I'm not even sure what it means."

3/20/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Complaint # XXXX against Wells Fargo Bank for not providing me with the applicable documentation to drop my PMI on my loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a month later I received a call from XXXX XXXX who refused to disclose his last name saying he was from Wells Fargo Executive Office ( Phone : XXXX ) and that the PMI paperwork was mailed to my address on XX/XX/XXXX. I indicated to XXXX that I had not received anything in the mail from Wells Fargo relating to the PMI being dropped and that I have USPS informed mail delivery. He said, we mailed it to your bankruptcy attorney on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo knows that my Bankruptcy had been Discharged as of XX/XX/XXXX and that any notification pertaining to my mortgage should be mailed directly to me. Wells Fargo reacted to my Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint instead of providing me with the PMI paperwork that I requested in XX/XX/XXXX to have it dropped. They did this intentionally and with malice in accordance with my previous allegations made in my original CFBP Complaint XXXX. 

I received in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX XXXX paperwork from Wells Fargo a Mortgage Insurance deletion letter ( see attached ) stating the following : "" We've enclosed the packet we sent you dated XX/XX/XXXX, which outlines your options for deleting PMI. Unfortunately, the account has not reached 80 % loan-to-value ratio ( LTV ) based on the original value of the property. If you wish to request PMI deletion based on a new value, please complete the attached valuation order form and return it to us. '' Obviously, I requested from the very beginning PMI deletion based on the current market value, why would I contact my lender for a deletion based on an original loan value? ( rhetorical question ). This is how Wells Fargo attempted to justify to the CFPB that there was no wrong doing on their part with my initial request to drop PMI based on the current value of my home, yet they refused to send it until the CFPB got involved. 

Enclosed in the package that was sent to me on page 2 of 9, Wells Fargo provided information about XXXX XXXX utilizing the Automated Valuation Model ( AVM ) at no cost to the customer. On page 3 of 9, Wells Fargo included the following with regards to my property, "" The Property Valuation showed a property value of {$460000.00}. '' This is according to their records. My mortgage balance is approximately {$290000.00}, which makes my loan-to-value according to their records 64 % LTV. Wells Fargo included a copy of Property Valuation Order Form stating they needed to get a Brokers Price Opinion in order to consider dropping the PMI from my loan. The cost of this was {$190.00} to 'Determine a new value without significant improvements '. I thought this was an excessive approach to requesting removal of my PMI. I complied with their request for a BPO ( Broker 's Price Opinion ) sending them the form and the check for {$190.00}. Wells Fargo received this on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The stipulations for meeting the requirements according to Wells Fargo Bank on page 5 of 9 to "" Cancel PMI using a new property value were : -No outstanding payment amounts. 
-No 30-day late payment amounts in the past 12 months.

-No 60-day late payment amounts in the past 34 months.

-This option used a new property valuation to determine the LTV ratio.

-Send us the enclosed order form to have a valuation completed.

-The property needs to be valued at {$390000.00} or more. This will bring the LTV ratio to 75.00 %. '' I meet every one of these parameters to have my PMI dropped. 

On page 7 of 9, Wells Fargo details the timelines for completion of the evaluation to take place. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX, a real estate agent from XXXX XXXX, AZ with XXXX XXXX to come out and walk through my property to take pictures. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX came to my home at approximately XXXX after parking his vehicle in my neighbors driveway for 10 minutes. XXXX informed my wife and I that he just broke his XXXX year old camera and couldn't take any pictures of the house. I suggested he utilize his cell phone for pictures. He literally walked to 2 bedrooms and took pictures, skipping another 3 rooms of the house. I informed XXXX that my home is even valued with my homeowners insurance carrier XXXX for {$440000.00} without considering any upgrades and improvements. My home is made of brick and mortar, not a manufactured home, it's fully upgraded from the floors to the kitchen, bathrooms and more. He mentioned that his Broker 's Price Opinion will be based completely on comparable sales. I live on XXXX acres, in a XXXX sq. ft. house with a {$24000.00} barn. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to ask whether he had submitted his inspection report to Wells Fargo Bank and they said that they would not accept his pictures. I contacted Wells Fargo to ask the status of my PMI being dropped and they said that I would receive something in the mail. 

I firmly and wholeheartedly believe that Wells Fargo is retaliating against me for my EEOC Complaint and their actions further confirm my belief. I also believe that Wells Fargo Bank is making every effort to delay my request in hopes that my property value will diminish as justification for not approving PMI deletion. Wells Fargo is also evasive in not answering any of my questions when calling customer service regarding an update, saying that I'll receive something in the mail. 

If they are doing this to me and they are not claiming their actions as retaliatory or discriminate, then they must be doing this to all of their customers."
3/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,Ive had an account with Wells Fargo for about 7 years now. They have a history of charging me overdraft fees before my account was actually overdrawn. I would add money to the account same day and I would still get charged overdraft fee. Many times I talked to them but they would not explain how that was possible and they would not reverse the fee. I heard something about them having to pay customers back for this so Im submitting a complaint as my account was previously affected with these abnormal fees many times.
3/20/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Confusing or misleading advertising or marketing,"The car loan from Wells Fargo. We were never disclosed the interest rate, we were constantly told its only XXXX $ and not told it was 8 % a very high percentage for co-signed loan with credit score above XXXX even though asked multiple times. They kept telling us that it would be nothing big and will be similar to people with similar credit but 8 % is definitely not right. 

I called them and asked if they will reconsider lowering the percentage as we were fooled and would never would have signed such a high percentage if we knew about it. Most companies have 0 % apr on new car but we didnt get it."
3/20/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with the interest rate,"Hello my name is XXXX XXXX and I had an auto loan with WellsFargo for more than 6 years and as of last year, I had paid off my loan. The reason for this complaint is that I believe I was overcharged for the loan because I signed the loan for 6 years and ended up paying longer than the contract agreement. I had the loan taken out automatically therefore I have lost track of how long the exact loan were paid out for. I am wondering if you would help me look into this matter. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

They froze my account while i was away from home and i had used XXXX to get there. I was then stranded amd forced to walk 7 miles home. Later then it seemed i was getting charged a bunch of fees despite using my account the required number of times to avoid the fees. I then attempted to close the account and they refused. Since i could not close my account, they comtinued to charge me overdraft fees once my money was no longer in the account. I then tried to open a new bank account with another bank. Because they had overcharged my account roughly XXXX dollars in fees, I was forced to give them XXXX dollars in order to finally close the account in order to open a new account with a new bank."

During this call, {$11000.00} was "" mistakenly '' transferred to my bank account, of which I was forced to withdraw and told to re-deposit into a bit-coin  ATM located at a XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, AZ. After this I went home and on my cell phone was prompted to go through a series of apps in order to get a refund of {$500.00}, during which I realized this was a scam. I received a call from my bank during this time and was alerted to a fraud. The scammer, when he realized he was caught, became verbally abusive.

3/20/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"In XXXX  I lost my job and requested numerous times that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage modify our payment due to my loss of income. They continued to report us behind and threatened foreclosure. Later after I regained employment, we submitted payments in full with proof from our bank that the payments were submitted and not returned. They claimed they never received them even though they accepted every prior electronic payment. Prior to this we had years of problems with them in applying payments and spending hours in the phone to get them applied correctly. We had to have consumer protection file against them and never got our $ returned and had to pay over XXXX  even though our bank verified transactions were completed. Since XXXX  when we refinanced we have had nothing but trouble with misapplied payments, lack of assisting with modification, and losing our in XXXX  which would have been more of the State of WV consumer protection would not have sent them proof of payments and yet we still had to pay an additional {$9000.00} as they magically found 3 payments after nearly a year. Since then, things have never applied correctly and we have kept all records and have yet to see these payments ever apply in full to principal, interest, or escrow. It continues to be a hassle and we should be much closer to paying off our home than their records reflect. Unemployment is stressful enough but their lack of assistance with our attempt to modify and their attempt to foreclose TWICE has been unbearable when we have always communicated with them and even had consumer protection try and assist us."

Our claim was denied on XX/XX/XXXX  stating the transfer was completed as requested. During this process we were told to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX customer to retrieve the funds. This customer took the money and is not returning phone calls.

As a former employee, I find this extremely alarming, I was once fully committed to Wells Fargo and remained unwavering even while other associates were stealing money and manipulating clients, my faithfulness remained perfectly intact and I am absolutely appalled that in recent years, Wells Fargo has repeatedly repaid my unwavering loyalty with heartachingly pain and suffering. As my former team members were being dragged to prison ( arrested on site, in front of all of us ) for stealing money, I was committed to training new hires and devoted to the development of Wells Fargo empire.

They made four different transfers. Whoever committed fraud did in fact NOT know how much was there otherwise they would have made XXXX transfer instead XXXX.

In the chaos, shock, and confusion of having someone actively make fraudulent purchases under my name the XXXX agent misunderstood and included these purchases in my original claim. This phone agent also missed some of the fraudulent charges that were reported. 
For example my claim of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX authorized on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX AZ XXXX XXXX XXXX {$610.00} Was missed when it should have been added to my original claim. A separate claim was made for this when I called to inquire to my original claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX a verified Wells Fargo letter was sent to me with this claim number ( Claim # XXXX ) verifying that this charge was credited back to my account because it was fraud. 
The next reason my claim was denied was Email was sent to verify some of the transaction and activity was confirmed via phone agent. Out of all the purchases made throughout that short period I only made a few. Speaking to an agent over the phone was confusing. Again I was XXXX at the time, I have a difficult time processing auditory information, and I was in shock of what had happened. MY claim was DENIED because of the XXXX purchases I did make but the agent helping me with my claim ignorantly placed in my fraud claim. 

Had these charges NOT been added my claim would not have been denied.

3/21/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"To whom it may concern, I've been fighting a fraudulent charge with Wells Fargo for the past 6 weeks. I've already submitted the charge for review 3 times thus far, all of which have been denied, despite me providing proof of my location during the time of purchase. I've jumped through all of the hoops Wells Fargo has set forth and now have the charge being reviewed for the 4th time. Below is the detailed outline of my history with this card and this fraudulent charge case. I appreciate you're attention to this matter. Wells Fargo is no longer cooperating with me. Not only is there money at stake, but my ongoing excellent credit rating and peace of mind are as well. 

Here is the history of my XXXX credit cards. I obtained my first XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was made aware by Wells Fargo and from my XXXX  card getting declined multiple times that my card had been involved in a BIN scheme with XXXX XXXX and had been suspended ; a new card was sent to me. I received the XXXX card ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and had it for less than a week before the XXXX fraudulent charges arose on XX/XX/XXXX. I am now on my third Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, and am seriously considering cancelling all of my Wells Fargo credit cards given the ease in which it seems these cards can be compromised and given my terrible experience with this fraud claim thus far. 

Here is the history of my multiple reported fraud claims for the XXXX charge of {$1300.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. 
-I received a missed call and voicemail and an email ( attached below as "" Suspicious Activity Email '' ) on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. When I received these alerts, I instantly checked my wallet to make sure I still had my card in my possession, which I did. As you can see from the suspicious activity email attachment, there were XXXX XXXX charges, one of which got approved for {$1300.00} and one that got declined for {$560.00}. If I made these charges, why would I try to make back-to-back big purchases at the same store? Clearly, the user of my information attempted to make a second big purchase upon successful completion of the first purchase. Upon receiving these alerts, I immediately called the fraud department to report the XXXX charges as fraudulent, including the charge of {$1300.00}. The charge was subsequently taken off of my account within a couple of days while it was being investigated. The investigation team had called me during this time period to ask me XXXX questions- if I had my card in my possession at the time of the charge and if my card had a chip, both of which I answered "" yes ''. 
-On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the XXXX charge had re-appeared on my credit card and called the fraud department the ensuing weekday on XX/XX/XXXX to re-open the investigation into this fraudulent charge. I was informed on that call that the claim was denied since the purchase was allegedly made with a chipped card ( which are supposedly encrypted and not reproducible ) and since I had my card in my possession at the time of the purchase. The purchase was therefore authorized. I had Wells Fargo reopen the claim on XX/XX/XXXX for further investigation. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the claims department to check on the status of my claim and they informed me the claim was denied again and the transaction was deemed authorized for the same reason as before. A manager in the department advised me to file a police report in order to obtain video footage to prove that it was not me making the purchase. I had Wells Fargo reopen the claim again on XX/XX/XXXX. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a police report with the XXXX regarding the fraudulent charge; said police report is still pending ( attached is confirmation of report submittal- "" police report confirmation '' ). On that same day, I also faxed the Wells Fargo claims and fraud department proof of my location via my cell phone 's location services on XX/XX/XXXX when the purchase was made. The screenshot of my location is attached below ( "" location timestamp '' ). I included the following cover letter with the image of my screenshot : "" Attached is my cell phone record of my location on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX, the date of the fraudulent transaction at XXXX of {$1300.00}. I received an unusual activity email from Wells Fargo that morning at XXXX and XXXX opens at XXXX, meaning the transaction had to occur sometime in the time frame between XXXX. As you can see from the attached photo of my location from XX/XX/XXXX, I was at my home XXXX XXXX XXXX during that time frame. '' XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I called the claims department again to check the status of my 3rd claim appeal and was informed that it had been denied again for the same reasons as the first and second time, despite the fact that I filed a police report and despite the proof of my location that I sent in from that day. I had my claim flagged and reopened again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Based on my research, I feel my rights as a customer/cardholder have been violated. According to the XXXX website, which is the type of card that was used in this fraudulent transaction, "" a cardholder has "" XXXX Liability '' and won't be held responsible for unauthorized transactions if XXXX ) reasonable care has been used in protecting your card from loss or theft '' - I had the card in my possession, meaning it was not lost or stolen and XXXX ) "" the reported loss or theft is promptly reported to my financial institution '' - I reported the fraudulent charge the same morning I was alerted to it by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. Per the XXXX website, "" If you believe that there has been unauthorized use of your account and you meet the conditions above, rest easy knowing you have the protection of XXXX 's XXXX XXXX promise. '' I without question fall under this statement and promise. 

Moreover, I know the law places certain requirements on the lender investigating my fraudulent claim and that it can't get away with only a cursory review. A reasonable investigation should involve : -Comparing the purchase pattern for the claim, such as types and amounts of purchases, with the consumer 's previous purchases. If this was actually researched, it is clear and obvious that this charge does not fall into my usual purchase patterns. 
-Reviewing the place of purchase relative to the consumer 's home. This purchase happened at a XXXX that is not in my neighborhood or in a neighborhood that is geographically convenient to where I live ; there are multiple other XXXX locations that are in closer proximity to where I live. In fact, I have never purchased anything from that XXXX location. 

My personal credit history should absolutely be taken into account in this case as well. My credit score has consistently been above XXXX over multiple years and I never have had a late credit card payment and have always paid off my credit card balances in full. 

I will be submitting a complaint to the Wells Fargo regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, regarding this issue and my experience. 

If you need any other information from me, please do not hesitate to ask. I work very hard for my money and I value my excellent credit that I've established over many years. This situation has caused me an undue amount of XXXXXXXX  and stress, causing me to lose sleep and productivity, which has negatively affected my health."

3/21/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"1 ) Discrimination by bank staff towards my daughter and I ( bank manager and tellers are all women XXXX XXXX ; the two gentlemen appear XXXX ) 2 ) Holding funds without partial release for no valid reason ; 3 ) Refusing to assist in resolving the bank hold, even after receiving valid documentation ; On the XXXX of XXXX we made a deposit via the ATM for a check from XXXX XXXX. It was a refund for damages to our transmission that another XXXX dealership had to correct. The ATM stated the funds would not clear until the XXXX, the following Tuesday. However, when we checked our account, none of the funds had been released and my daughter received an email that the funds would be held until the XXXX of XXXX without an explanation. 

Thinking that the bank might be concerned the check was fraudulent, we walked to the bank with the check stub and the XXXX waybill showing the check was valid. However, the teller made one excuse after another why she couldn't help us : "" It's a XXXX account, you deposited it at the ATM, the check was made out to me instead of my daughter ( even though I'm on the account ), the amount is too high to release..? '' I then asked to speak to the manager. She walked away, returned, and said the manager was out to lunch ( XXXX ) and asked us to wait. She came back to us and said the manager would be back in 45 minutes, did we want to leave our name and number?. We had already been at the bank about 25 minutes ( waiting in line, speaking to the teller ). 

We opted to leave and went to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The bank manager there informed us that typical holds are 3-5 days and that the bank teller could have called XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify the funds and the account. 

I researched online and found that Wells Fargo 's standard business process is to release up to {$220.00}, then wait 3-5 days for the check to clear. Sometimes, in rare instances, up to 10 days. The account was opened in 2019 ; had payroll auto-deposits for almost a year- it's well established. She had also recently opened a savings account. 

We went back the next day to speak to the manager. When we walked in we received a "" Welcome! We'll be with you shortly '' from a man at a desk helping a customer. Another young man, also at a desk, got up and said he'd get the manager, but the teller we had spoken to the day before stopped him mid-stride. My daughter told me she heard her tell him, "" she knows ... ''. 

We could see the manager speaking to someone behind a glass partition. Even after the man said "" let me get out of your hair... third floor..? "", the manager followed him around the corner, out of sight. We waited a couple more minutes until it became clear that she was intentionally avoiding us. We left, heading back to XXXX XXXX XXXX to open new accounts with my daughter 's payroll funds that had auto-deposited. 

I filed a complaint with the OCC ( Dept of Treasury ) thinking that they could affect the situation. I was disappointed to find out that the OCC passed it to Wells Fargo to investigate themselves. So much so, that on the XXXX of XXXX, the day after the funds cleared, we returned to withdraw funds to put in the XXXX XXXX accounts. Thankfully, there was a new teller there. Giving her the benefit of doubt, I explained that the previous week I had never felt as discriminated against as I had then, and asked her to help my daughter with her transaction. I went and sat in the waiting area with my dog XXXX ( wearing her vest to carry the funds ). 

The teller who had been rude previously went and got the manager who came to speak to me. She said that I had to be "" nice '' to the tellers and that I was making "" defamatory claims ''. I said, let me get my phone so I can record this ... She walked away, stating that I could not record her. In Georgia, we have the first person recording law - I can record any conversation of which I am involved. I also made it clear that I had already filed a complaint with the OCC.

My daughter completed her transaction. I asked about the teller and she said "" she was sweet '' and that her name is XXXX ( phonetics XXXX  ). I was relieved. The irony is that we are XXXX. We know and understand the history of XXXX in America moreso than any other groups because our ancestors were sold into slavery in the XXXX before XXXX were imported. Then the "" great starvation '' by the XXXX  gov't - food sources and livestock were taken, at gun point, leaving little for the XXXX folk to eat. Millions died and millions more left for the Americas, XXXX and XXXX. There is a strong chance that the staff working at Wells Fargo have XXXX ancestry as well. This is why I taught my children to not be prejudiced - that person might be a relative! 

Thankfully, our car is now repaired and when it comes time to close the account, we can drive to a different location and not be subjected to the outright blatant discrimination we experienced at that branch ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA )."

When I approached his desk, he would hang up the phone, and tell me I wasn't allowed to hear what he was saying, and to go sit down. After an hour and a half, he finally released my drivers license ( I wondered if he sold my info on the internet during all that time ) and told me to go to a bank teller named "" XXXX ''.

I still wonder what he did with my Driver 's License ID for 1.5 hours. I called my fraud company, put fraud alerts on all credit companies, put extra fraud measures on all my banks.

It was an insurance check I was cashing. He knew that. He still wanted to know. I finally told him it was for my house repairs. AS a bank official XXXX had access to my Social Security Number, my License number, and as he had my driver 's license for 1.5 hours. He could have done anything with my information.

3/21/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"I am trying to find out about the recent Wells Fargo penalties for improper processing of loan modifications. 

I had a home and had been living in it from XXXX  until Well Fargo foreclosed. Wells Fargo refused to allow us to do a loan modification to reduce our payments. We were told that we had too much income to qualify for a modification. At that time the only income we had was from student loans which we got 3 times a year and they were about {$6400.00} each of the 3 times a year that we got them. We were told that because we were low income enough to qualify for pell grants ; that the {$5500.00} in pell grants that each of us got ; and that money all went straight to the college; was money that would be counted as income for us and that would make us over the limit to qualify for a modification on our home loan. 

We did lose our home and it basically financially destroyed us and then two years later Wells Fargo sold our house for about half of what we owed on it when they foreclosed. I would really like to know how a person could find out if they are owed money from Wells Fargo? I am really sure that Wells Fargo will not do one honest thing unless somebody is standing over them with bat and making sure they do what they are suppose to.

Wells Fargo refuses to answer me in writing and keeps trying to pawn off my complaint to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the administer of the claim. I have talked to them and they do not provide an answer and will not send me any response in writing.

3/21/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"This complaint involves actually two complaints during my house ownership for a loan modification that was applied for in XXXX and took 2 years ( XXXX ) to complete with a whole lot of red tape and confusion in between. A couple of years later I was still struggling to make ends meet and applied for a second loan modification. In the course of the second loan modification, again much confusion from Wells Fargo and delays incurred. To give you an example of what kind of things occurred, Wells Fargo overnighted to me documents that required signatures for someone else 's loan modification who had property in Hawaii that included their personal information. I also have copies of these documents. Then in XXXX I was threatened with a foreclosure. I put my house up for sale because I was struggling and soon thereafter was advised Wells Fargo was foreclosing. A month before the foreclosure was to take place, a short sale was in the works and Wells Fargo was advised. I still have all of the paperwork of everything transpired, i.e. letters, emails and the signed real estate contract from the potential buyers which was submitted to Wells Fargo in plenty of time to negotiate a resolution and avoid a foreclosure. I have emails from the real estate agents verifying that all of the documents that Wells Fargo requested had been sent. I have documentation that Wells Fargo would resubmit it for review if it were to get close to the deadline which did end up happening due to complications with communication on what was sent to Wells Fargo. Suddenly it all fell through the cracks due to delays in responses which pretty much seemed deliberate and a total lack of efficiency, and I ended up getting foreclosed on when it could have been avoided. In addition to the above situation which was put in a previous complaint which ultimately was "" closed '', due to the fact Wells Fargo stated they were unable to reach me at the telephone number on file, I am adding this to a second complaint to again show the way Wells Fargo handled the first complaint. If they couldn't reach me by phone, why was I not advised by a letter stating they could not reach me by phone and therefore attempt to confirm my correct phone number. They didn't have any trouble writing me the letter stating that they "" sincerely regret this isn't the outcome you were looking for '', but that I am free to provide additional details and they would be happy to research the information. Needless to say, the letter they sent which was authored by XXXX XXXX, an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, ended his letter providing a phone number to reach him if I had questions- which I called several times ( in case I was misdialing ) and it gave a recording each time that the number was "" not in service ''. So, instead of dealing directly with Wells Fargo, I am choosing to file a second complaint to show CFPB how unprofessional and inadequate Wells Fargo continues to handle things. By now I am well aware of how they work and obviously nothing has changed, and I will get nothing but the run around from them so I am starting over with another complaint to CFPB. For the record so there is no additional confusion, my phone number is XXXX."
3/21/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"I went to buy used vehicle from dealer called XXXX XXXX XXXX  situated at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and decided to buy XXXX XXXX xlt. I applied for auto loan through them and also asked if their company do business with wells Fargo auto because i have had banking with wells Fargo from a long time. I was approved and the finance representative of XXXX XXXX  came up with interest rates of 8.49 % through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and 8.69 % through wells Fargo. I was denied when i asked the rate quote paper showing the rate of interest of both banks. Because of less rate i went with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and signed the loan contract and the vehicle was delivered to me with proper tags and registration. Almost a week later on XXXX of XXXX i got call from dealer to come or stop by to sign some papers those were missed by mistake. I went there to sign but upon reaching i found their was whole new story. They were trying to switch me from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Wells Fargo auto loan because kemba denied few days later for some reason. When i said i do not want to pay higher interest rates then the representative assured me that i will get the same rates as XXXX was giving which was 8.49 % but from different lender. My first original concern was about the dealer who was probably lying to me about the truthful rates of interest and intentionally wanted me to go with their favorite lender because i am wondering how come the wells fargo later agreed to give me lower interest rates but not at first place when i applied the application. Then on XXXX XXXX i went to dealer again and signed the loan contract with wells fargo but surprisingly even at more lower rate which is 7.69 %. 

Secondly the most important concern now is as below : I tried to contact with Wells fargo to get some clarification about my concern and asked them clearly that what was the original rate of interest that wells fargo offered me on XXXX of XXXX. Why the rate of interest are not disclosed to consumer who is paying back. Wells Fargo filed a case under XXXX Complaints Management office. Case number XXXX. But Executive office case specialist named XXXX XXXX tried to ignore the whole concern and did not resolve the case. Suddenly on XXXX of XXXX closed the case without resolving it."

3/21/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"XXXX XXXX XXXX  Mandatory settlement conference in residential foreclosure actions : My complaint here with Wells Fargo has to do with ; 1 ) XXXX XXXX, Court held a mandatory settlement conference in which Wells Fargo did not act in good faith in negotiations and improperly denied me a mortgage loan modification. 
2 ) Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ) to my monthly mortgage payments. 

XXXX ) CPLR XXXX - I obtained a Home Mortgage from Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Wells Fargo claimed I failed to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment and every payment thereafter. At this point Wells Fargo started the process of foreclosure on me. Wells Fargo assigned the mortgage to XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and Wells Fargo became the Mortgage Loan Servicer. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX started Foreclosure proceedings against me on XX/XX/XXXX and receive Summary Judgment XX/XX/XXXX. 

After my attorney answered the Foreclosure complaint on XX/XX/XXXX and the next process was the Court held a mandatory settlement conference per XXXX XXXXXXXX which was held approximately XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX per court records but actually went into early XXXX. 

When I submitted my first HAMP application, Wells Fargo was using my income for the 1st quarter of XXXX, XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, averaging it out and times it by 4 quarters to get an average yearly monthly income. My attorney explained to Wells Fargo, since I had a Painting Contracting business, this 1st quarter period is during the winter and the slowest income period for my business. Typically, XXXX XXXX are the slowest work period. 

During this time Wells Fargo submitted to my attorney my monthly average income and a Mortgage Modification Proposal that lowered the principal owed, reduced the interest rate and extended the mortgage to a 40 year. In this proposal, Wells Fargo showed my prior mortgage payment broken down by principal including interest, property taxes and insurance. The new proposed monthly mortgage payment was broken down the same way, principal/w interest, property taxes and insurance. 

Now at the time in reading theses documents, I see Wells Fargo has added an unauthorized charge ( fee ) to my monthly mortgage payment in insurance of {$130.00}. This is the basis of my # 2 complaint above ; 2 ) Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ) to my monthly mortgage payments. 

Wells Fargo got back to my attorney saying the Mortgage Modification was denied due to was the proposed modified monthly payment amount would be more than the HAMP guidelines ( could the unauthorized Insurance Fee added to the error in denial? ). My attorney responded back saying Wells Fargos that there was an error in their calculations. My attorney wrote that my gross monthly income ( using the average of first 3 months of income ) and using the proposed mortgage modification that Wells Fargo purposed, the income did fit the HAMP guidelines and asked them to please go over there figures again since the denial did not correspond to the information Wells Fargo provided. Wells Fargo responded again saying I did not qualify based on their calculations. At this time, it was around XX/XX/XXXX where we resubmitted my income since I was now in my prime income season. With my new income more than doubling Wells Fargos previous calculated monthly income, I more than qualified with the HAMP guidelines. At the end of XXXX Wells Fargo responded back that I was reviewed for modification and was informed I was denied again but this time due to that XXXXXXXX XXXX does not offer modifications. 

Why would Wells Fargo go through this entire process of 10 months, proposing to me a new monthly mortgage modification, then come up with XXXXe doesnt offer modifications? Why did Wells Fargo put me through this? 

Even though I was denied due to XXXX XXXX does not offer modifications, Wells Fargo did participate in the HAMP program. Wells Fargo reviewed the loan for a HAMP modification through themselves but again I was denied due to insufficient income. Again, could the unauthorized Insurance Fee added to the monthly mortgage payment adding to the payment be part of the error in denial?

Wells Fargos own attorney asked Wells Fargo and XXXX to reconsider their decision, but was denied again. 

How is it possible that Wells Fargo is denying based on insufficient income? The first denial was based on my 1st quarter income where my attorney correctly showed Wells Fargos Calculations are in error and incorrect. Now showing my income in XX/XX/XXXX which more than double my 1st quarter income and Wells Fargo again in error is denying the mortgage modification. Wells Fargos own Attorney in seeing the calculations asked Wells Fargo and XXXX to reconsider. Why would their own Attorney, who Wells Fargo refers to as ( mediation counsel ) agree with my Attorney and ask his paying client to reconsider? 

I believe through documents between Wells Fargo and my attorney, my attorney and Wells Fargos attorney ( mediation counsel ) that the calculations Wells Fargo used was in error as my attorney responded to them and explained, furthermore when I showed a drastic increase in my income later in the year, I was still denied. Why early in the negotiations did Wells Fargo provide a proposed mortgage modification showing all the changes in the new mortgage with the New purposed mortgage payment amount if XXXX XXXX does not offer modifications? After being informed about XXXXXXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo ( who does participate in the HAMP program ) denied the modification again under insufficient income where my attorney clearly showed I did qualify under HAMP Guidelines. At this time, Wells Fargos Own Attorney Mediation Counsel asked XXXX and Wells Fargo to reconsider but got denied. Im pretty sure Wells Fargos Mediation Counsel is aware of the HAMP guidelines in which the reason he asked for them to reconsider.

Through previous law suits in which Wells Fargo has been charged multiple times for Denying mortgage holders Mortgage Modifications due to an error in its automated software for calculating whether a borrower should be offered more favorable loan terms in lieu of foreclosure I believe I was affected by this error in their software glitch and denied the mortgage modification.

In previous lawsuits ; Wells Fargo said the computer error affected "" certain accounts '' that were undergoing the foreclosure process between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo 's underwriting tool had miscalculated whether homeowners were eligible for the Home Affordable Modification Program or other government programs designed to help people remain in their homes despite difficulty making payments. Because of the glitch, around XXXX Wells Fargo customers either were improperly denied mortgage modifications or were not informed they could qualify to have their loan terms modified. 

Wells Fargo entered the US Government HAMP program and had received a total of {$1.00} XXXX in HAMP incentive payments from the U.S. government by summer XXXX, becoming one of the four largest HAMP servicers. Just 17.5 % of the HAMP incentives Wells Fargo received went to homeowners with the remainder going to investors and the servicer. Homeowners who benefited were in the minority, as Wells Fargo denied close to 60 % of requested HAMP mortgage modifications.

Please also see below Previous Lawsuits Due to Wells Fargos unjustly denying Mortgage Modification 2 ) Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ) to my monthly mortgage payments. "" As well they may have been charged incorrect fees and other costs. '' Now in reviewing correspondence between Wells Fargo and my attorney, I see Wells Fargo was charging me for Home Insurance in the amount of {$130.00} in my mortgage payment plus the fee included of an interest rate of 6.875 % per month. 

From the First day I received my mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX, I had House insurance through XXXX XXXX policy # XXXX XXXX, which I can prove. I refinanced with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo never informed me they were going to apply a fee for House insurance to my Mortgage Payment. Since XX/XX/XXXX XXXX has always insured my house under the same policy number and I have never been late or missed a payment since it is a automatic withdrawal. As per my Mortgage agreement # 5 Borrowers Obligation to Maintain Hazard Insurance or Property Insurance. I will obtain hazard or property insurance to cover all buildings and other improvements that now are, or in the future will be, located on the Property. The insurance will cover loss or damage caused by fire, hazards normally covered by Extended Coverage hazard insurance policies, and any other hazards for which Lender requires coverage, including, but not limited to earthquakes and floods. The insurance will be in the amounts ( including, but not limited to, deductible levels ) and for the periods of time required by Lender. Ect Wells Fargo illegally and unjustly added an unauthorized charge or fee to my monthly mortgage payments in the amount of {$130.00} plus interest. Wells Fargo Never notified me they were charging the fee or they were paying for the house insurance. {$130.00} fee x 6.875 % interest rate comes out to a charge of {$130.00} per month in unauthorized charges.

For the first year of the Mortgage with Wells Fargo in XXXX there were 10 months remaining for a total year cost of {$1300.00} in insurance. For the 12 months in XXXX the yearly fee is {$1600.00} for insurance. From XXXX XXXX the total paid is {$8300.00} for insurance, add in XXXX and the Total during this period paid to Wells Fargo in unauthorized charges ( fees ) is {$9700.00} for insurance.

If this {$9700.00} was applied to my mortgage payments it is equals to about 3 months in mortgage payments and thereby not making me In Default of my Mortgage. Due to Wells Fargos actions in charging an unauthorized charges ( fees ) would not have put me into default situation according to Wells Fargos records and Foreclosure proceedings filed against me. 
Wells Fargo engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 1031 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), 5531 ( c ) ( 1 ). Per CFPB law suit # 28, # 29, by assessing me unwarranted charges and fees Conclusion : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Court held a mandatory settlement conference in which Wells Fargo did not act in good faith in negotiations and improperly denied me a mortgage loan modification. Due to an error in Wells Fargos Software Glitch they in error denied me a mortgage modification as argued by my attorney and as by Wells Fargos own Attorney Mediation Counsel asking XXXX and Wells Fargo to reconsider their denials. 

XXXX ) Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ) to my monthly mortgage payments. In adding an unauthorized charge in my monthly mortgage payments for Insurance in the amount of {$130.00} plus interest. In doing so, Wells Fargo collected an additional {$9700.00} in unauthorized fees which would, according to Wells Fargos records put me into default and into Foreclosures Proceedings. Wells Fargo engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 1031 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), 5531 ( c ) ( 1 ).

Previous Lawsuits Due to Wells Fargos unjustly denying Mortgage Modification due to an error in their software used to compute : As per CFPB lawsuit "" Under the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions violating federal consumer financial laws, including by engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPBs investigation found that Wells Fargo violated the Acts prohibition on unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Consumers were illegally assessed fees and interest charges on auto and mortgage loans. Some mortgage loan borrowers may be eligible for damages whose requests for modifications to their loan to avoid foreclosure were unfairly turned down. As well they may have been charged incorrect fees and other costs. Customers may be eligible for damage payments for wrongful foreclosures or reporting errors that resulted in loan applications being denied when they should have been approved.

The CFPB order requires Wells Fargo to : "" Provide more than {$2.00} XXXX in redress to consumers : Wells Fargo will be required to pay redress totaling more than {$2.00} XXXX to harmed customers. These payments represent refunds of wrongful fees and other charges and compensation for a variety of harms such as frozen bank accounts, illegally repossessed vehicles, and wrongfully foreclosed homes.

Respondent has incorrectly denied mortgage loan modification applications and miscalculated fees and other charges for thousands of mortgage borrowers, as set forth below, resulting in at least {$190.00} XXXX in remediation being paid to affected mortgage borrowers. Some of these failures were the result of software errors that persisted for multiple years. 
XXXX. Respondents mortgage servicing operations experienced other errors that resulted in Respondent assessing borrowers unwarranted charges and fees in various situations 28.

29. Respondents acts and practices described in paragraphs 23 through 27 caused substantial injury to consumers that was not reasonably avoidable or outweighed by any countervailing benefit to consumers or to competition 30. Thus, Respondent engaged in unfair acts and practices in violation of 1036 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and 1031 ( c ) ( 1 ) of the CFPA. 12 U.S.C. 5536 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ), 5531 ( c ) ( 1 ).

As per SEC - A quarterly filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission in August 2018 revealed that Wells Fargo made an error in denying mortgage modifications to hundreds of borrowers. The securities filing says that Wells Fargo discovered a calculation error in its automated software for calculating whether a borrower should be offered more favorable loan terms in lieu of foreclosure. Wells Fargo says the error affected XXXX homes that were in the foreclosure process between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
As Wells Fargo explains, two federal government programs require Wells Fargo and other lenders to offer loan modifications to keep people in their homes when they are in default, rather than going through the expensive process of foreclosure. Wells Fargo did not comply with this law, it says, due to a software glitch that affected XXXX mortgages that were in default. Ultimately, XXXX homes were foreclosed on, when a mortgage modification should have been offered, according to Wells Fargos own disclosures. 

In another case On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX approved an {$18.00} XXXX settlement for the class. Throughout the case, Wells Fargo admitted that it should have offered these borrowers a mortgage modification, but the bank denied violating any laws and the case came close to trial. The class action lawsuit we filed alleges that Wells Fargo failed to implement and maintain the proper software and protocols to correctly determine whether a mortgage modification was required under federal regulations. The lawsuit also alleges that Wells Fargo knew of the error in XXXX but failed to disclose it for nearly three years. The complaint concludes that Wells Fargo acted negligently in denying loan modifications to hundreds of borrowers, at a time they were struggling, and failed to uphold its duty under the Home Affordable Housing Program ( HAMP ) to issue modifications to all troubled homeowners who qualified."
3/21/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,Im not sure this is an issue you can help with or if it is too late. We banked with Wells Fargo in 2013. We were always charged fees that made no sense and never received an actual resolution. We werent allowed to access our funds at times. We were always told that it was in our best interest to keep our account numbers up. Not even sure what that meant. We left Wells Fargo when it seemed we were losing money to the bank. It was out of control. I was recently told to reach out to you with this information. Thank you for your time.

Someone had stolen my information for my online account and stole {$2000.00} from a local ATM. I filed two claims with Wells Fargo and the company said they performed an investigation on my behalf. They came back and said they denied my claim. Which is absurd since I was nowhere in the location of the ATM where my money withdrawn.

3/21/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,While I was banking with Wells Fargo in 2017 I was incorrectly charged over {$100.00} in overdraft fees because I paid several small bills and then a few days later saw that I had money in my account to pay a larger bill. They immediately took out the large payment and then a few days later i checked my account to see that all the small payments had been taken out a few days after the large payment had gone out. They charged me overdraft fees on EACH INDIVIDUAL small payment that went out. I immediately called to resolve the issue and they did nothing but make excuses for the delays in taking the smaller payments out several days after they had been sent. I had to pay all the overdraft fees and ended up closing my checking account. I would like to be compensated for this after finding out Wells Fargo is now admitting to fraudulent banking activity during the time I was affected.
3/21/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Banking errors,I was a customer at Wells Fargo for 11 years before the closed my account for no reason. In those 11 years they constantly over charged me and took money out of my account for overdraft fees that their fees made me overdraft and then they charged me for it. This happened over and over over the 11 years. Then when I said I was going to go higher then the branch to get some of my money back they closed my account after they charged me so many fees it put my account in the negative. Its not right what they are doing to people. Because of all the money they took from me I lost my house and had to move in with family. It really did affect my quality of life and I still havent recovered. It would be the right thing to do to give me some kind of compensation for all the years I banked with them and they were stealing my hard earned money!

I ended up having to sell my home for less than I paid for it. In addition, Wells Fargo cashed a post-dated check that spiraled my checking account into a deepening negative balance, when they could see my balance wouldn't cover the post-dated check on the day it was incorrectly presented by a plumbing company who had agreed to wait to submit it on the day the funds would be deposited. Following is an XX/XX/XXXX email I sent to a state representative trying to get help : Dear XXXX XXXX, I'm trying to get help- I've been unemployed for over XXXX year and I'm not behind with my mortgage but I will be soon. My loan 's origination date was in XXXX XXXX, past the XXXX XXXX, XXXX deadline the foreclosure prevention help programs all seem to have. 

Wells Fargo will not help me, I've spent the last month sending and resending the same financial information to them. I have equity in my house which I'm sure appeals to their bottom line, but I will have to sell well below what I paid for it ( if it sells ), according to my realtor who just sold her house in a short sale. My roof also has a leak so my house is not in top condition for sale. 

Will there be any flexibility in the new Oregon Homeowner help programs in regards to that XX/XX/XXXX deadline? I've been trying to maintain my credit rating and not go into default but the bank options- waiting periods, 3-month forbearance with balance due at the end of three months in a lump sum - all lead to damaged credit and possible foreclosure in the end.

Reasons : I was in process of divorce and NC laws require a couple to be separated for period of one year before divorce can be filed in the district court. I am attaching divorce decree to show the dates of separation and final divorce. 

Wells Fargo could have helped me with updating the address and send me statements so I would not be late on my payments.

It had, unfortunately jammed the machine, and spit out the majority of the cash that I had deposited. However, there was still money stuck in the machine of an unknown amount in the denomination of {$20.00} bills. When I had made a claim I had let them know it was between {$100.00} and {$300.00} and {$20.00} bills stuck in the machine after over a month and a half, I have been told twice now after re-opening my claim that there was no cash to be found inside the machine, and that the machine was balanced, which I know is physically impossible."
3/22/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I filed bankruptcy XXXX XXXX XXXX. Mortage from Wells Fargo was Discharged through Bankruptcy, per documents I have. 

Wells Fargo continued to send notices about collecting the mortgage payments, however, they refused to speak to me on the phone, citing the bankruptcy protection laws. Wells Fargo foreclosed on my home, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ in XXXX. 

In addition to foreclosing on the property originally mortgaged ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ ) owned by myself only-Wells Fargo included a XXXX XXXX XXXX which listed 5 lots ( only one owned by me and not included in the original mortgage. And included my ex husband on the paperwork. 

I believe Wells Fargo illegally foreclosed on my home and other properties ( which had nothing to do with anything ). 

Wells Fargo refused to speak with me, but continued to harass me with notices and correspondence ignoring the bankrupty protection laws."
3/22/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I have contacted Wells Fargo Bank about the Mortgage Wrongful Foreclosure CFPB has order to pay for their improper denial of mortgage loan modification they did in the past. 

I am submitting this complaint, because I have contact them many times to inquire in reference to the amount they should pay me under the order of CFPB, they only took my name and cell phone number, and have decline to let me know when they will process my refund, and have not contacted me at all. 

I tried for almost 2 years to request a mortgage loan modification, and I ended hiring an office to help me take care of the modification, but Wells Fargo bank did not help in any way. They sold the property, when they even agreed that they would help.

I want to request the aid of CFPB to have the Wells Fargo Bank issue a check to pay me off for the improperly denied mortgage loan modification, ilegal foreclosure and sale in a public auction on XX/XX/2018."

I was in trouble with a reporting agency. But I didnt deserve for you to hold my money."
3/22/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Ive noticed someone finally filed a lawsuit with Wells Fargo over their overdraft fees. I doubt they will contact me as after having numerous months of them doing this to me, I changed my bank. But, what they would do is hold up certain charges or hold up a deposit ( that they had showed already hit ) until days later to ensure Id rack up numerous overdraft charges. Id make calls to get it corrected and every once in a while theyd waive one but Id still have to pay 2-3 or some months even more in overdraft fees. So like I said, losing that much money each month because they would move around dates of when things hit to ensure Id over draft made me finally close the account and bank elsewhere. Id love to have even a fraction back of the overdraft fees wrongly charged. I cant even log into my account now to pull up the records, so Im sure theyll get away with not paying me."
3/22/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I have been building a custom home since XXXX. It should be closing within the next 30 days. I approached Wells Fargo back in XXXX of XXXX to get pre-approved, which I was. I filled out disclosures and paid for the appraisal fee to move the loan process forward in early XX/XX/XXXX. I have submitted paperwork requested. I was working with a Mortgage Loan XXXX, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, Virginia, which is where I am completing my new construction build. I was told once I signed the disclosures and paid the appraisal fee, the mortgage can be moved forward and I can lock my rate at any time. 

I was working with XXXX XXXX constantly between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to see current rates, discuss the lock process, and get several pricing snapshots over this period. I fully understood what it took to lock a rate. 

At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the Wells Fargo website and plugged in all of my information accurately to price a XXXX ARM on a XXXX XXXXXXXX loan. I found a 5.875 % rate with {$870.00} back in credit. After months of research and waiting, I finally decided I would like to lock the rate. I called XXXX at XXXX and told him I would like to lock this rate. XXXX responded that he did not see the same rate, his was similar but not exactly the same. XXXX asked me to send him a screenshot. I re-ran the model at that moment, took a screenshot and send XXXX the email, explicitly saying "" I ran the tool. Would like to lock this rate on the XXXX XXXX. '' XXXX said he isn't sure if he can get this rate, but since I have proof from the customer website he would see what he can do. He instructed me to sit tight and he would get back to me. 

I checked in with XXXX the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, to which he said he will need more time. The rate had increased by this conversation. I was still okay with locking the current rate, but I had to wait for XXXX since the rate he was trying to get approved was much better. 

I checked in with XXXX on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. He said he did not have a decision yet and would get back to me when he hears back. The rates went up even further on this day. 

On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX finally called, over XXXX hours later, since the rates came near the same level I wanted on Tuesday. He admitted the team did not want to honor my deal the previous two days as rates were raised. He admitted they would honor the rate on Thursday since the rate came back down. 

I told him I would let me wife know. He said call him back by the end of the day. I called him back at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and he said he never locked it and now the rates soared. 

This matter went up the corporate ladder at Wells Fargo. XXXX 's boss, XXXX XXXX, spoke with me on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. He said he is aware of my clear email to lock and would take it up with his boss, XXXX XXXX and get back to me Friday afternoon. XXXX XXXX waited until Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, as rates skyrocketed, to get back to me and say they wouldn't honor my rate anymore. 

I take issue with these practices by Wells Fargo : 1. The customer tool is misleading. The consultants can not view the same tool so why mislead the customer into thinking they will get these rates. The consultants rates are different. They admitted this to me and XXXX 's boss, XXXX XXXX, said he has pushed corporate to fix this for a long time. 

2. Why was my rate lock tabled for over XXXX hours, and the decision hinged upon the rate getting closer to what I wanted my lock at? If they were going to honor it, why not lock it right then and there? I was forced to the sidelines while the market was volatile when I would have accepted several rates during that time. 

3. This matter went up the corporate ladder at Wells Fargo. I was strung along by both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in order to perhaps get the rate I wanted for an unnecessary amount of time. They were rate-watching in order to have a shot at making a good case, when in fact it should be a simple yes or no right then and there. 

These deceptive mortgage practices must be fixed. The Wells Fargo customer tool need not falsely advertise rates and mismatch with consultants. I should have my rate honored, as this team put me on the sidelines with the hope/confusion of my rate being locked for an entire week during an extremely volatile period."
3/22/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a complaint against Wells Fargo for violating the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) in relation to a dispute that I filed with the company. Specifically, I submitted a dispute to Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/22 regarding a charge on my credit card account. After an extended investigation period, the dispute was closed on XXXX/XXXX/22, and the charges were re-applied to my account without proper resolution of the dispute. 

I believe that Wells Fargo violated the FCBA by failing to properly investigate and resolve my dispute within the required timeframe of 90 days. Furthermore, by re-applying the charges to my account without proper resolution of the dispute, Wells Fargo has potentially violated my rights as a consumer. 

I have attempted to contact Wells Fargo to seek an explanation for their actions, but have not received a satisfactory response. I am therefore requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that Wells Fargo complies with all applicable consumer protection laws. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

The fundz were diverted by an unscrupulous bank employee at the XXXX XXXX n then she told me to try cashing it at a check cashing store after she alrd cashed the check leaving sequence nos. on the bk of the check. 

The othr branch in XXXX SC rolled on my substitute checks n image cash letters of the amnt of {$7200.00} roughly ... she told me to have a seat whl she verifies the checks n then in came a guy who left the bank with all {$7200.00} in an envelope in his hndz... the wad of cash was XXXX in the envelope n I saw this with my own I 's.

Wells Fargo is saying I am responsible for these charges because I activated the account on XX/XX/XXXX. I did activate the 3rd credit card I received but it was after these charges were made. I made a purchase of {$44.00} on the card through XXXX. I did not make any of the other charges. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$110.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$93.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$50.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - {$8.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - {$9.00} XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX - {$110.00} XXXX  I was able to get a hold of someone at this store who confirmed the card was used for a watch battery and a {$100.00} VXXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- {$120.00} and {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- {$9.00} I got a letter in the mail stating that the original card, that never showed up, was activated by me. That is impossible unless it was activated upon registering for it online. Either way, the 10 or so charges made in XXXX between XXXX, were not made by me. I swear it on everything I love. I did not make these charges. 

You won't find another XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX or XXXX charge anywhere on any of my accounts. I did NOT make these charges. Wells Fargo is sticking me with {$780.00} worth of fraudulent charges I DID NOT MAKE and reported when I became aware. 

Something has to be done about this. The fact that no one can verify who made the charges is a problem. It was not me. I have paid my {$44.00} for the XXXX purchase. That is the only time I have used the XXXX credit card. 

I registered for this card because I wanted to transfer money from one card to another due to the 0 % interest. I am now scared to use it because someone else has already used it. 

I spoke with XXXX Store XXXX on XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXX, and they confirmed the card was used XX/XX/XXXX for {$110.00} for a watch battery and a XXXX XXXX XXXX, RED FLAG! I DID NOT MAKE THIS CHARGE OR ANY OF THE OTHER CHARGES. 

All the charges were made downtown XXXX. I live in XXXX Ga, which is not far away, but I have a XXXX and a XXXX and a XXXX and a XXXX as well as a XXXX literally 2 miles from my doorstep here in XXXX. I did not make these charges. I would never need to go to any other the places this card was used at. 

Is there any other way to check and see who used the card since WF keeps coming back saying I made these charges? I did not make these charges. I am a middle-class citizen who can not afford to make a {$780.00} payment for charges I did not make let alone spend {$780.00} in 3 days. 

Please take my complaint seriously as this is really messing with my well-being. I should have never applied for this card. This is a real-life nightmare! 

I have since made the 1st payment on these fraudulent charges to maintain my credit score. 

I attached 2 pictures. One is of the 2 cards I received, and the second picture is of my call history from the day they said I activated my card. 

Thanks for hearing me out."

This was due to a {$66.00} payment from life insurance being drafted from my account. 

Wells Fargo has started a new initiative called Extra Day Grace Period ( EDGP ), giving XXXX customers XXXX days, instead of XXXX, to make deposits before XXXX EST ( XXXX ) to cover any overdraft and avoid fees. Here 's the information on XXXX : XXXX : XXXX XXXX I have XXXX I got to work to cover that negative balance from the {$66.00}, I had already deposited {$16.00} at an ATM on XX/XX/2023 before XXXX XXXX ( also attached ), then the {$66.00} hit my account after that, and I had already scheduled a {$50.00} deposit from an outside account to go into my Checking too, that transaction deposited same day, later on before XXXX XXXX ( attached ).

I found out today a {$35.00} overdraft fee was assessed on the {$66.00} transaction. Yet again, Wells Fargo "" stacked '' aka reordered transactions around to create an overdraft fee. Even though the funds covered the {$66.00}, per their own XXXX guidelines / policy.

Wells Fargo would say I needed additional escrow even when I had changed insurance companies lowering my homeowners insurance rate. I contacted Wells Fargo several times but could never reach resolution so I gave up. I had mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX before selling and in that time making over payments each month I barely paid down the principal. I seen that Wells Fargo recently was caught doing illegal practices with auto and mortgage loans and haven't been contacted. I want to know if I'm owed any money from the settlement.
3/22/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"XX/XX/2022, I tried to deposit {$900.00} in Wells Fargo ATM, XXXX XXXX, MD. But ATM screen showed {$800.00} instead of {$900.00}. While I was trying to figure out to take out {$900.00} back, I happened to touch the button for withdrawing {$1000.00} without my knowledge. When I got the money back, it was XXXX instead of XXXX. I went back in the branch to talk about the {$100.00} ATM machine took and never gave back. 

The banker named XXXX ( or XXXX ; XXXX hereinafter ) didn't seem to believe what I said. Then, the couple behind me mentioned that a gentleman outside was looking for me because the cash from ATM was hanging out then got back in the machine. I ran out and found the man standing in front of ATM, and thankfully he entered in the branch and testified that he witnessed the money hanging out of ATM. Until then, I thought the hanging money it was {$100.00}. 

But, XXXX kept on asking few times about {$1000.00} withdrawal that I didn't know about. I only touched the button, which I learned later on that the button was for withdrawing {$1000.00} and the money the gentleman saw was {$1000.00} that got back in the machine. 

Now, I got {$1000.00} back mostly thanks to the gentleman 's in-person testimony. However, Wells Fargo said their investigation concluded that {$100.00} was not wrongly taken by the money. 

I counted the money of {$900.00} at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX where I stopped by before going to Wells Fargo. Plus, XXXX commented that the ATM I used ( at that time ) has "" problem '' and is waiting to be replaced. I asked her to shut down ATM and/or put up a sign so that the customer would not go through the same problem I went through. But she said the headquarter didn't approve of shutting it down or putting up the sign. 

I personally put the sign on the same day after I got a paper and pen from XXXX XXXX XXXX  I went to after Wells Fargo. ( I have a picture for that ) I got Wells Fargo 's investigation result and called back the number to dispute. But the customer representative on my case said there is no other way to dispute the amount, and this is the final conclusion. I asked a lawyer about Wells Fargo 's negligence in managing malfunctioned ATM machine that led to taking my {$100.00} wrongfully. But I was told it will take a lot of money to file a lawsuit against them. So, I have given up until today when I saw a post at XXXX about ATM malfunction and got it resolved through CFPB. 

{$100.00} is not big money to some people, but it is big money for me. Plus, the bank has no right to take my {$100.00} without any reason and simply concluded their investigation."

They were messing and threatening my credit which was excellent at that time. In my humble opinion these were not random mistakes but a "" program '' schemed up by some corporate knuckle head. Every contact with Wells was extremely similar in the way they tried "" handling '' me. This scam was from XXXX. Thank you for your time."
3/22/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I am filing another complaint because Wells Fargo Bank continues to misrepresent the truth in my case. The latest correspondence came on XXXX. Again they stated, as per their tape recordings, that I only applied for a {$20000.00} and never asked for a {$10000.00} as I have asserted over the last year. In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a {$10000.00} loan with loan consultant XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated since my house is almost paid for, I should borrow {$100000.00}. I told him that I am a XXXX XXXX  on a fixed income and I can only afford to pay back {$10000.00}. He began to badger me and tried to force to borrow {$75000.00} which I also refused and refused his next offer of {$50000.00}. He continued his rude tactics trying to force me to borrow XXXX XXXX.At that point I informed him that I have a XXXX  XXXX  and he is causing me to have an XXXX XXXX. He continued and told me that. I was not going to get a {$10000.00} loan because there would be no benefit in keeping the loan at {$10000.00} due to the closing cost being rolled over into the new mortgage. This is evidenced in the correspondence submitted dated XX/XX/XXXX on page two, third paragraph. The fact that XXXX XXXX also tried to force me to borrow more than I could afford to pay back is evidenced n the correspondence submitted dated XX/XX/XXXX, on page two, third paragraph, where Case Specialist XXXX XXXX stated that XXXX XXXX recommended the higher amounts to save me on out of pocket closing cost The correspondence today again insisted that their tape recordings prove that I only asked for a {$20000.00} and never asked for a {$10000.00} loan which is totally false. I asked for copies of these tapes as per the Freedom of Information and The Open Records act but my request was refused."

During this time I was unfortunately XXXX  in a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I had given the debit card to my mother to give to my significant other at the time so she could have access to the funds and account to be able to make purchases for our animals at home to take care of her or she needed to send me something she would have money and not have to worry about being the only one working. Upon being 2 weeks into my sentence she went to go purchase a new dog crate and she got denied as unsufficient funds. This is when we began our investigation to figure out what was going on meanwhile I of course I am XXXX and my significant other time had my power returning so she could figure out what was going on. Long story short it seems that my ex wife over 10 years ago at that time had somehow got an access to my account and added the card to I'm assuming her phone that she was going all around town making purchases eating and things like that as we started to look at the withdrawals and the checking account in savings accounts activity sheet which showed Her sending wire transfers like XXXX to her dad 's bank account through Wells Fargo which is the bank I was using as well as her dad. Mind you my exwife and I have not Share the bank account and almost 11 or 12 years much less you can I had never had her name on it and was in new one I had created way after our divorce.. My significant other at the time started the process of reporting it trying to get the police to do something who wouldn't as well as getting Wells Fargo and everytime she's put to Wells Fargo they would say oh yeah we can see that this is not your fault and then suddenly they would change their mind and say there's nothing we can do sorry and that's it. So much to say that they refunded like a {$100.00} out of the XXXX that was stolen out of my account to turn around and take it back from her. When I was finally released I went to Wells Fargo myself. My significant other and I went in to the local branch by the house and explained to what was going on short of the paperwork of me being iXXXX  that there was no way I was doing this.. Shoulder all the paperwork from Wells Fargo and how they just denied to get my funds back or do anything and how the police won't even return calls or online police reports. This Wells Fargo representative literally was saying this is crazy this is definitely not your fault we're gon na get your money back don't worry she gets on the phone and calls the main office I suppose and sit there and talk to him for about almost 10 minutes once she suddenly just hangs up the phone looks at me and says sorry this said there's nothing we can do and that's it. I have written them I have called them I've gone to local branches this is ridiculous..

3/22/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,Wells Fargo Home Mortgage requires an Automated Valuation Model ( AVM ) to remove our monthly PMI payment and requires the homeowner to pay for a new property valuation. The burden of proof for a property valuation reduction should fall to the party assuming this reduction. A current public valuation model assessment places our debt to equity ratio at 56 %. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage position on this matter is unreasonable and predatory.
3/22/23,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,I had a VA mortgage through Wells Fargo where I feel it was mishandled. Would like to know if Im elgible for compensation being that I might have been harmed by illegal activity during the life of the loan.

They were reporting fraudulent transactions on my account. The recipient also also stated for the transfers to be refunded there needed to be a transfer from my account which would be refunded immediately, upon checking the morning after the refund was not in my account and that is when I realized that it was fraud. I filed a fraud claim with Wells Fargo. They closed the claim stating it wasnt on their end that the fraudulent transaction occurred, they stated a request has been sent to the receiving institution and there was nothing else that could be done on their end and closed the case."
3/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"I held accounts with Wells Fargo for multiple years, and found out via my bills bouncing that my both my checking and savings accounts had all been immediately closed on me with no warning. This happened about XXXX of XXXX I had money from my direct deposit from work in my checking at the time they closed it, and {$1400.00} in savings i needed in order to move into my new apartment in XXXX of XXXX 
I have attempted to go in person to a branch and get told i have to call a specific phone number. I've also called that department as directly multiple times each month since this happened. I've been told multiple times that they are mailing a check with the contents of my account, and even told they have reprinted and resent the check as well. I have given them multiple available addresses to me to mail this too as well and nothing as arrived to any of them. 
They claim that my account was flagged as "" Spam '' even though I was a customer with a decent history with the company. This made me unable to access my deposits I needed to get into my new apartment and has caused many issues since. I am currently in debt for the amount they owe me so that I could secure my apartment."
3/23/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I am sending in a complaint/response to my previous complaint ( XXXX ). Not only did this company lie in their response to me I feel as though no effort was put into really looking at my case. They lied and stated that they tried to get in contact with me during the time I was trying to get a loan modification but they could not reach me. Not only is that a lie I was the one in fact calling them repeatedly to get my case settled and back on track with my loan. I would like Wells Fargo to prove that they have tried to reach me in any way and was unsuccessful in all their attempts. My phone number has literally been the same for the past XXXX years. And I remained in the home until they told me to get out. In my complained I stated exactly the respresentative I was in direct communication with the entire time I was going through the process and the person handling my current complaint ask me in the letter to whom did I speak with that told me not to begin making payments again until they completed the modification process. That in itself let me know not only did they not read me complaint, they did not research a thing in regards to my foreclosure because they should know the exact name of the rep that was helping me and all of the correspondences and documents that was exchange between she and I. They should have all of this information on file. If I had the money I would sue them directly for the way they have badly mishandled this entire situation. I honestly see why they been sued but the government and I hope they get sued again and go bankrupt."
3/23/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX  I made a call to Wells Fargo Mortgage regarding my loan # XXXX being paid off. They were already aware that the house was being sold as the escrow officer requested a payoff statement few weeks prior. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX to stop the payment on my XXXX payment for {$6600.00} ( it was set up to be withdrawan from my Wells Fargo checking account ), the person who helped me with the phone told me that she could stop the payment, and told me to call back in a few days to get the "" fee '' ( {$25.00} I think ) to be reimbursed. And I was told that I would be receiving in the check amount of approx {$18000.00} from my escrow balance. 

Meanwhile, when I made an inquiry again on the phone on around XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that Wells Fargo took {$6600.00} as my XXXX mortgage payment from the escrow balance so I only would be receiving around {$11000.00}. I explained that it was not what I was informed previously, and they should not take XXXX mortgage payment when loan was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX. She then told me that they would be reviewing and I would be receiving the communication later. 

Then I suddenly received the check from Wells Fargo in the amount of {$11000.00} ( attached ). It is NOT the amount I am entitled to received from my escrow balance. As XXXX statement shows ( attached ), I had {$18000.00} as of end of XX/XX/2023. When loan was paid off on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX, I should be receiving the full amount. Instead, Wells Fargo took {$6600.00} out of my escrow balance."
3/23/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,"Managing, opening, or closing your mobile wallet account",None,"On XX/XX/XXXX I performed a XXXX transfer from my business account with another institution to my personal account with Wells Fargo. The transaction did not reflect as posted from my business account until XX/XX/XXXX, causing me to mistake it for a fraudulent transaction due to another encounter with a scammer attempting to scam my business account. I reported the transaction as fraud with XXXX. I then later realized that the transaction was valid after tracking my activity with Wells Fargo, but XXXX had already denied and closed my claim, citing that the transaction was valid as it did originate from my mobile device. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I realized my Wells Fargo online profile had been blocked. I called to inquire, and was told that it was due to that fraud claim, which I then explained and my profile was unblocked. I came to realize just a few days later that my XXXX token had also been blocked due to the same reason. From that point I spoke to several different individuals from the Wells Fargo online fraud team, the online banking support team, and customer service. I was told by a young lady that my token was blocked because of the fraud and that it simply could not be unblocked. When I inquired as to why, she responded that she did not know and that she had been out on maternity leave and before she left that they could lift the restriction but since being back they could not. She then transferred me to online banking support when I asked her to speak to a supervisor. The young lady in online banking support let me know that I should have asked for a supervisor in online fraud which I told her I did do. She then transferred me back to that department and I again requested a supervisor. The young man I spoke with told me that although they could see from XXXX that the transaction was valid, that they simply could not unlock my token for use. Again, this did not make any sense if my transaction was valid and it was confirmed valid by myself and the outside bank so I asked for a supervisor and was told that he would escalate to their escalations team and someone would reach out in 3-5 business days. No one ever reached out to me, and that then began a series of me calling and requesting to speak to someone that could explain to me why they were refusing to unlock my XXXX token with a validated transaction. After about XXXX weeks of calling and being transferred to other departments, XXXX, and even early warning services I was finally transferred to the escalations team. I was then told by the associate that because there was a fraud claim that was closed and not withdrawn that they would not unlock my token. I again said that this did not make any sense, and the young man told me that they do not have anything that says this is valid. I responded that I could provide documentation and that I was already told that Wells Fargo knew it was valid by another associate. He told me that he could not tell me any more than what I had already been told. I made the decision then to close my account, and I spoke with an online banker. After speaking with her, she recommended that I speak with someone from the customer advocacy group. The person that I spoke with from there explained that someone would contact me about my claim. The next person to contact once again told me that another person from their executive escalation team would contact me. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX by phone and email on or around XX/XX/XXXX. She let me know that she was investigating my claim. In about 3 hours I received another email from her that she was closing my claim because Wells Fargo had not received any new information from me and the decision to block my token would stand although I never actually spoke with her or was provided an opportunity to provide any new information. I called that same day and initiated another complaint. I was contact on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX once again but I informed her that I could not speak to her because I was at work and on a zoom call. She again informed me that she would be investigating my claim and she would send me an email. She never called me back, so I attempted to call her back in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that she and her supervisor were unavailable, and the associate I was speaking with would let XXXX XXXX know to call me back. Literally about an hour later I got an email from XXXX XXXX that she was again denying my claim. I still have not ever spoken with her or been provided a chance to provide any new information, nor told what new information could be provided. I am completely outraged that I could fully explain and validate a transaction, and it is enough to unblock my online profile but not my XXXX token? Im also completely confused as to how a claim that clearly isnt valid is enough to deny access to a XXXX token, and as to how Wells Fargo can know this information but still block my XXXX token for use. I have tried to settle this with them but the lack of accountability and willingness to even speak with me to offer a logical explanation is too bewildering for me to continue to contact them for a reasonable solution."

When I asked them about the money I deposited the supervisor XXXX then said she can not see what I deposited and that they normally return money in 5 business days. I then pointed out to her that it's been over 7 business days. I asked her when I would get my money back and she said there is no time table when I will get my money back. I asked her if there was anyone in the entire company who could tell me when or if I would get my money back and she said there is no one that can. I also asked her for a ticket number or something I could submit about the dispute I am having with them and she said there is no documentation she could give me.

I called the bank/ credit card company immediately to report the fraud situation. I looked up for all of those charges happened in XXXX.

I asked if I needed to go to the police station to get a police report and they said no need to. 

About a week, the bank took off those fraud charges. But after I received a new card, the bank put all of those fraud charges back into the new account. I also received a letter from the bank writing me they denied my fraud claim. In the letter they said they found that no fraud occurred, or that the transactions were authorized.

3/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Non-sufficient funds and associated fees,"Third in a series of related complaints against Wells Fargo # 1 filed with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint # XXXX # 2 filed with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint # XXXX # 3 filed with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint # to be assigned. 
The following is an absolutely true, verifiable report of Wells Fargo 's repeated, intentional, deceptive, criminal efforts to manipulate factual history by altering, manipulating, and inventing banking records, after the reported events had already occurred ( after-the-fact ), in an effort to.improperly and illegally profit from their banking clients, to create vicious circumstances to justify these deceptions as accurate, and to hide these deceptions from overseeing agencies, such as the CFP Relevant Historical Events between myself and Wells Fargo : In addition to the millions of false bank accounts and credit card accounts that WF created without the knowledge of their clients/account holders, for which WF received record fines and was required to pay penalties to these individuals and to the federal government - WF has engaged in other forms of deception and manipulation of banking records to profit from their clients.

I would argue that much of WF entire business model is designed to profit from the falsification of its banking records and theft of the assets entrusted to them by consumers. 
I have already received two payments in compensation for Wells Fargo violations, nearly {$5000.00} in {$2000.00} and nearly {$400.00} in XXXX. 
These payments were for two independent causes, though the basis for the payments overlaps. 
Wells Fargo violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by creating 'mini-branches ' that were structurally deficient. They did not provide any option for seating of individuals with physical  disabilities that made prolonged standing impossible, or difficult, and painful. 
The factual circumstances of the second violation is directly relevant to my current complaint. It provides undeniable proof that these current violations were absolutely intentional.and part of a systematic program to defraud and steal from its depositers by the manipulation of banking records and creation of entirely fictitious banking records, in an attempt to change established, factual events, after-the-fact. 
Beginning in XXXX, Approximately XXXX, Wells Fargo engaged in a series of intentionally fraudulent actions with my WF checking account. 
As I would make deposits to my account and later, make purchases that drew from these fund, Wells Fargo began to change the order of historical events, to create a fiction. Well after deposits were made and transactions comp! eyed - all of which utilized only available funds- never in excess of available funds- WF would later change the banking record - reversing the order of transactions ( debits ) and deposits ( credits ). 
In doing so, Wells Fargo created artificial Overdrafts in which funds were drawn in excess of available balance- before those funds were provided. 
At the tine, I reported these events to several agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You should have a record of these complaints. Fortunately, as I have in the current circumstances, I had "" screenshots '' - a digital photo of the current presenting screen on a computer - capturing a record or communication at a given time. In effect, it is a photograph of a transaction as it was reported at that time. 
My screenshots proved that on least ten separate occasions, Wells Fargo reversed the order of my deposits and transactions to create a negative balance and charge me excessive overdraft fees. My screenshots clearly showed the transactions as they occurred and later, they showed the same banking records, intentionally manipulated by Wells Fargo. 
These criminal acts are a matter of historical record and Wells Fargo was subject to and found guilty of these same actions to innumerable account holders in many states across the USA. 
I just happened to be one if those victims.

You would think that after record fines, WF would have learned their lesson but as I've communicated in prior communications with the CFPB, this behavior is integral to WF 's business model and only when penalties are greater than profits and executives are given prison time, will this criminal behavior cease.

Current Events between myself and Wells Fargo : This is the third of individual but entirely connected complaints by myself against WF with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Since these complaints each require individual cause to be considered XXXX complaints, they can be distinguished as follows : These events concern my Wells Fargo Social Security XXXX, direct deposit account and associated Visa debit/checking account. 
1. Complaint 1 - WF processed two transactions that I made with XXXX. Both transactions did not clear XXXX 's system, meaning on neither transaction was I able to complete the purchase I was making. I communicated with XXXX about this trouble with their online system, they acknowledged the problem and I made alternate arrangements. 
Despite these transactions not going through XXXX, WF put them both through as pending transactions. 
Prior to this, I had made a deposit of over {$1000.00}. I then transferred {$690.00} for a transaction to XXXX. There were several XXXX dollars remaining in my account On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted the two transactions with XXXX. The online website for XXXX reported that the transaction failed. I attempted the transaction again. It also failed. 
Nonetheless - WF put both transactions through my account - despite XXXX 's system - clearly rejecting both transactions.While these two charges were pending, I waited for them to 'drop ' from my account when WF had realized its error. Although it is quite likely that as XXXX 's system rejected the transaction, WF 's system should have responded in kind - unless their system was negligently faulty or there was intention by WF from the start, to falsify my transaction records.

While these two charges were still pending, WF charged me {$35.00} for an overdraft fee. 
As stated, after my {$1000.00} deposit and {$690.00} transaction to XXXX, there were my balance was positive. However, WF used these still pending transactions- improperly or mistakenly debited from my account- and created a negative balance, which they used to justify my overdraft fee. 
As far as I know, pending transactions can not be used as the basis of an overdraft fee until it clears the account. This is especially true for transactions that were never approved by the merchant ( XXXX ). 
I reported this impropriety to WF. 
Their email response on XXXX, was that I had one day grace period to pay the overdraft, which had resulted in a negative balance Following this, WF then dropped the pending XXXX transactions, made without XXXX 's consent, from my record. However, they retained the {$35.00} overdraft fee. 
I emailed and stated that they couldn't charge me an overdraft fee for a negative balance created by improperly processed, pending transactions, since withdrawn from my account. 
Their response by email, was the first ( in this current event ), unquestionably, intentionally, falsified banking record. It stated that it was mot the pending XXXX charges that created a negative balance and resulted in this overdraft fee. 
I emailed WF and called them a liar. I provided screenshots to prove there were sufficient funds in my account before and after the XXXX transaction. 
*** First complaint filed with the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Complaint # XXXX I accused WF of intentionally and fraudulently manipulating my banking record to create a false overdraft circumstance from pending and withdrawn charges. 
I then received another email from WF - once again willfully, criminally, manipulating the existing bank records. Since I had provided screenshots that proved I had sufficient funds to cover the XXXX transaction, and the negative balance was the result if debiting my account for the improperly processed and pending XXXX charges - that had since been withdrawn from my record. 
The next part is almost too incredible to believe if it were not for the absolute evidence and their established history of this exact form of deception. 
WF - days after the pending XXXX transactions had dropped from my bank record. After they claimed it was my XXXX transaction that caused the overdraft, after I emailed WF and stated : a. pending and withdrawn charges can not be the basis for an overdraft fee I attached : b.screenshot proof that the XXXX transaction could not have resulted in a negative balance and caused an overdraft fee because there were sufficient funds before and after the transaction. 
Wells Fargo responded with further deception and newly fictitious bank records. 

WF NOW took the further step of justifying the overdraft and more importantly, hiding their previously manipulate banking records - BY REINSTITUTING THOSE SAME TWO XXXX CHARGES - that had been pending and DAYS AFTER THEY HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN. 
ONCE AGAIN- they created a fictitious banking record, after the fact. 
This time, it attempted to establish that the original two XXXX charges were not only valid charges made by XXXX on XXXX - despite neither transaction being successful and despite XXXX apologizing for my inability to make these transactions, WF NOW CLAIMED - that both XXXX transactions were valid - AND WERE NEVER PENDING - that both transactions actually cleared my account back on XX/XX/XXXX. 
With this new rationale, my overdraft charge was no longer the result of a XXXX transaction for which I had proved there were available funds- and it was not the result of PENDING and WITHDRAWN XXXX charges. 
NOW - The overdraft was valid because it was the result of valid XXXX charges that cleared when they were first made on XXXX and created a negative balance. 
*** Second complaint with the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint # XXXX ... on the basis that they had reconstituted false previously withdrawn charges AND were using that as the basis for my overdraft fee. 
Following this, over the next few days, these are the latest events. I told XXXX that WF had twins figured the charges. 
XXXX again acknowledged that WF had processed charges days after the fact, charges that they never approved. They told me they would try and get the charges reversed. In the interim, I heard from WF by email stating that they needed mire time to resolve the matter. 

Meanwhile, WF then, once again, reversed itself, creating new fictitious banking history, by "" provisionally '' dropping those two XXXX charges from my account. 
However, they refused to remove the original overdraft charge. 
I then received several communications from XXXX and requested that they involve their legal department and conduct their own investigation. Unfortunately, XXXX, was unwilling to deal with WF ( I can't really blame them ). 
XXXX decided to just pay me for those two charges that WF had re-instituted. However, they paid me thus money before WF had again removed these charges from my account.

Thus - I now have two payments from XXXX for transactions that never occurred the direct result of Wells Fargo is manipulation and creation of banking records, after the fact. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo. 
They claimed they had resolved the matter and stated I needed to contact them by XX/XX/XXXX and notify them if I wasn't satisfied, they would consider the matter settled and closed. 
They claimed they had resolved the situation- though no such resolution exists and even if it did, this has become much, much more than a banking error. 
1. I have received payments from XXXX for services that I never purchased, as a result of WF 's deceptions. I have no idea what the legal status of those funds is.

2. The original overdraft fee was never removed from my account.

What nerve, what gall WF has. So sure of its ability to abuse and defraud its consumers. 
On XXXX called the number provided. They didn't even provide a contact person, just the requirement that I call XXXX. 
I made my call on XX/XX/XXXX between XXXX XXXX PT. I asked for a Supervisor. I asked for his employee identification number. 
He flatly refused. All I could get him to state was that his name was XXXX and he was in N. Carolina. He was rude and borderline abusive. He kept interrupting me. 
I said, "" Fine. Whether you take note or not, I can honestly say that I called you at WF on this date and time, provided the WF claim # XXXX and stated that the matter was very much not resolved and that I would be making a third complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
I, a XXXX  XXXX individual having previously had funds, stolen from me through Wells Fargo 's intentional deception and manipulation of my banking records- for which I received two separate financial settlements from Wells Fargo. 
Once again, Wells Fargo is making my already impaired life that much more difficult and is stealing what very, very limited funds. In fact, this WF account is not only a direct deposit for social security XXXX ( XXXX ) payments but also for supplemental security income ( SSI ) payments. 
Restitution is not restoring my account to its prep manipulated state. Restitution is a heavy federal fine and a substantial payment to myself for the misery and hardships they have caused me - not once but twice. 
Unless you hold WF accountable and require that they compensate me for these abuses, you are telling them in no uncertain terms that there are no repercussions for defrauding their customers and in my circumstances, REPEATED defrauding me, an individual more susceptible to harm than most, on Permanent XXXX with an income that requires additional federal assistance. 
You are telling WF that there are no negative consequences to manipulating and fabricating a federal direct deposit account. You are telling Wells Fargo that it is perfectly acceptable ton create fictitious transactions that require major, International corporations like XXXX, that they have the power to create fictitious charges for their services that require them to pay for services that were never provided, just to get WF off their back. 
Has this become the new norm? Wasn't the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauestablished to prevent these abuses- and when they do occur, to punish them through the only real, tangible form available, through financial penalties and required punitive compensation. 
After decades of these continued abuses, the executives who design these criminals approaches, now integral to their business models, are being financially compensated in amounts greater than ever before. 
Our refusal.to hold these corporations financially liable and the executives who earn more and more with no personal, legal liabilities. This refusal to dissuade, discourage, penalize, and prevent these ongoing criminal frauds, only worsens what many have identified as the greatest crisis currently tearing apart America. 
It is the source of our ever-increasing social and political polarization. It is the ever widening canyon of class and economic status between the increasingly powerless, increasingly poor majority and the very select few, wth the privilege of legal immunity, political and social influence, and wealth is that is no longer measured individually in the millions but in the billions. 
Where then, is the distinction between the willful criminal activity of the banks- and the willful refusal of government regulatory agencies, those individuals appointed or elected to protect us but fail to intervene, to punish, or prevent. 
Why is this? What does it mean that banks are too large to fail? It means the fallout of such a failure would result in financial instabilities to all, including those in power, to a greater extent than the criminal activities and stolen assets that these banks freely engage in without any concern for personal consequence and minimal concern for corporate consequence.

How can this situation be resolved? I would like to see WF executives held criminally liable for these financial crimes. Why is their immunity assumed. Why is it that stock brokers and business managers and accountants are now receiving jail time for their financial crimes but bank executives have not?

If the US can prepare criminal charges against a former US President, why are bank executives held accountable? As a rational, realistic individual, I have little faith that any of the WF executives responsible for defrauding me will ever hear about it, let alone be punished for it.

So how else can I be compensated for fifteen years of financial abuse, theft, and complete disrespect? I can be paid compensation - money - something that will very tangibly improve my life and provide opportunities otherwise unavailable to meXXXX XXXX They paid me compensation before- they should do so again - but more. I am notunreasonable. I have a good understanding of my value and the time and energy they have robbed from me, a permanently XXXX man, whose time and energy is already limited. I am asking for a payment of {$25000.00}, a truly trivial amount to Wells Fargo but a realistic amount that will provide very real opportunities to improve my life.XXXX I had a legal education though I never was an attorney. If I went to an attorney for assistance, realistically, I think if an attorney was willing to represent me in this matter, it would be on a contingency basis. In that circumstance, the attorney would insist on a much, much greater amount of compensation. 
It's also possible that an attorney or law firm would seek out similar cases to my own and form a class action suit. If other individuals have half the evidence I do, it could be a record award. 
And If I am not successful obtaining compensation for my hardship, it would be almost as good if Wells Fargo was required to pay fines - great, huge fines, in excess of their previous fines. 
I think it's realistic, given that repeating the same crimes has no excuse or mitigating factors. It practically requires near-crippling fines, certainly enough to reduce the available funds for executive bonuses."

I do not agree with so many fees that I have paid since XXXX. I called the bank again today and they answer, talk to us and say they will solve it and hang up the phone without giving any satisfaction, the treatment they give to the customer is absurd. and also when we open the complaint they promise to call us and solve it and they do nothing. I don't want them to call, I WANT THEM TO RETURN my money to my account, that's all. Enough of this clowning and being treated like garbage by the bank.

3/23/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I experienced property damage to my barn on XX/XX/XXXX and received my insurance checks from my insurance company, XXXX XXXX. The checks were made out to myself and Wells Fargo, my Mortgage company. 
Wells Fargo mandated that I submit all my checks to their "" property loss '' division in XXXX, OH, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Wells Fargo sent me an initial payment of {$40000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, which I gave to my contractor to begin the necessary repairs.

In order to receive additional funds, I have to request an inspection through the Wells Fargo property loss website, which they outsource to XXXX XXXX, who hires a 3rd party to do the inspections. 
Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX my first inspection was completed and submitted by the 3rd party to XXXX XXXX that evening showing pictures of the progress and stating the project was around 40 % completed. 
Wells Fargo 's property loss website shows an incorrect date of the inspection being done on XX/XX/XXXX, and states the "" inspection failed '' with no details on why. 
The owner of the 3rd party company who completed the inspection and myself called XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX who stated that XXXX at XXXX had changed the completion of the project to 0 % and would not be able to release more funds to me until the project was 100 % complete, which is impossible to do without more of my insurance money being released to me. 
My barn is an {$86000.00} project and my contractor needs money from me to finish buying materials and to finish the project. The project was started in XXXX with demolition and the rebuilt started on XX/XX/XXXX once I was able to give my contractor the {$40000.00} down payment. The project was supposed to take 3 weeks and my contractor has projects scheduled right after me. We are now at a standstill on the project as my contractor has XXXX funds from me to buy the rest of the materials to complete the project and pay his employees. Wells Fargo is holding my insurance money hostage and preventing the project from being completed, and messing up my contractor 's schedule.

I called Wells Fargo Executive complaints on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX who opened a case # XXXX which was assigned to XXXX XXXX. 
I called XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and he had made XXXX progress on any resolution. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked to speak to a supervisor and was told one would call me back that day. As of XX/XX/XXXX no one has called me and Wells Fargo has not resolved my issue or released any additional of my insurance money to me. 
This is a huge issue and I need Wells Fargo to immediately wire funds to my account so that I may pay my contractor so he can buy the rest of the materials needed and complete the project. This is an urgent situation due to my contractor being forced to abandon my project for another that has money to pay him unless I get my money immediately."

3/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,Unable to open a checking account for the one that I requested
3/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"XX/XX/2023 On Wednesday XX/XX/2023, I was the victim of identity theft. An individual posing as a Wells Fargo representative, called my personal phone claiming there was fraud on my checking account. This scammer called from a Wells Fargo phone number XXXX and even sent the OTP code to my phone. This code was also sent from a Wells Fargo phone number that comes through as ( XXXX ). This is the same number that I receive all Wells Fargo Free Messages to verify a code. The most recent time I received a message from that number was on XXXX, while at the bank on the phone, from a representative who needed to verify my identity. Having had my Wells Fargo accounts hacked in the past, I was thankful for the ( seeming ) intervention. The last hack was on XXXX amounts of {$1900.00} and {$2000.00}. The text came from WF ( XXXX ) on XXXX. The scammer said that due to consistent fraud, they would assign me a new account and proceeded to do so. 
It was not until the next evening, when attempting to log into my account, I discovered a problem. Unable to log in, I called the bank the next morning, XXXX and was advised I needed to go into the bank in person due to fraudulent activity. Once at the bank, the bank manager was able to gain access to my account and was able to identify all the scam related transactions. The manager was able to confirm all six of my accounts were compromised. The total amount moved around and wired out was {$44000.00}. 
While I was in the bank, I was told the accounts were blocked due to suspicious activity. The addresses and notification statuses were changed on each account so that I would not see or be notified of the transfers. The address was changed to another state and I had to verify my correct address. I saw two emails from Wells Fargo requesting confirmation of the wires. I saw the emails with the verification codes sent these are not the same codes that were sent to my phone. 
On XXXX during my time at the bank, I was informed there would be a 10-business day process for the fraud claims. After 4.5 hours spent on the phones with the fraud department and the bank manager, my accounts were changed. At my request, my credit card accounts were changed as well. The cards were closed for all accounts. The following week, on XXXX, I spoke with a representative who advised me the money was still at the bank, blocked due to the fraud claim. On XXXX, I was given the same information by a different representative when I called to check on the status. I was told I would be mailed a letter once the matter was resolved. I was also told by a different fraud representative, the investigation did not start until XX/XX/2023, a full 5 days AFTER I submitted my claim in person. 
On XX/XX/2023, I received a text message from Wells Fargo XXXX, informing me of a charge on my debit card. However, this card should have been cancelled on XX/XX/2023 when all my other accounts were closed. I called the bank, same day, and once again, told them to close down the card. The address was changed again to the false state that I corrected on XX/XX/2023. I changed the address once again back to my address. 
On XX/XX/2023, I received a letter indicating the completion of the investigation for the online cash advance from account and the funds would be returned to that account, however, there needed to be funds in the depositing account. Due to fraud, there was no longer funds in that account. The money was placed back onto the credit card, with the fees. The cash advance is accruing fees daily. Another charge in the same amount was placed onto my business checking account, now doubling what is owed. This resulted in my account being in the negative. They advised that the funds moved around in each account would not be returned because the depositing account, was negative. The wire returns were denied stating I was at fault for giving out my username and password. NEVER at any point did I provide that information to any individual. 
On XXXX I spoke to a gentleman in the fraud department who stated that they spoke to me personally to approve the wire. I asked them to prove it because no one spoke to me. They could not and would not even investigate it. I called and spoke to another representative and she said that there were no such notes about them speaking to me on XXXX or XXXX. 
As a customer, dealing with such a stressful situation, I was hoping to receive assistance, guidance, advice and perhaps a bit of compassion. However, When I called to speak to the investigator on XX/XX/XXXX, I was allowed to leave a message with a representative to have her return my call. When she called back on XXXX at XXXX, she was very rude and sarcastic, blaming me for it all. She questioned what kind of phone I had and why my calls did not go back for months. I advised her that I can call the cell phone company or look on my statements for the numbers that contacted me. She placed the call on mute and let the time run. When I called the next day to give her the numbers and prove it was a Wells Fargo number for phone and text, she rudely told me that it didnt matter and that she was not repeating what she said, the claim is denied. She verbally admitted that I was scammed and that it was nothing more she could do. I asked for her name and ID number and she questioned why and said that it was property of Wells Fargo and that she could not provide that information. She later said her name was XXXX but still refused to give me an ID or reference for the call. 
Since then, I have called the Fraud department several times to try and obtain documentation or proof that someone spoke to me about a wire. I have also called and reported the behavior of the investigator and the treatment that I received as a long-standing customer.

I received new bank cards for my business line of credit and was sent two cards and a user who I did not authorize. I called with my concern and sent a letter via fax and mail to have the user removed. I have also had four clients who have been hacked in the past three weeks and another member, who was in the bank on XXXX, complaining about a {$20000.00} hack on his account. This is proof that XXXX XXXX security practices are not secure, and they do not have the customers best interest at heart. 
It took me a while to write because of the emotional distress I have experienced from {$44000.00} being taken from me and leaving me with XXXX dollars, overdraft accounts and daily cash advance fees. I also had faith since being told that the money was still in the bank, that it would be returned to me. Every time I call, the customer service representatives are nice, but the fraud department is brutal. When I reminded them that two representatives told me that the money was still there, even after the investigation started, they disregard it. I filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX. I have visited the receiving bank to let them know that someone wired money to them. 
I refuse to believe that after being a customer for over 15 years that Wells Fargo would treat me this way and not even do a proper investigation. When asked about the FDIC, the representative stated that would not cover the finances. They are supposed to call me and find out what happened before deciding. The letter I received said the claim was open on XX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. They did not call me or ask me anything. The representatives also told me that the claim would be open until XX/XX/XXXX because they had 10 days from XX/XX/XXXX, five days after I filed it on the XXXX. I am at least looking for compensation for all of the in-house transfers that I was not aware of and all of the fees associated with any money moved. The wires and transfers were all fraud and the scammer posed as me, stealing my identity. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter."

Shortly after opening the new account, Wells Fargo closed it and withdrew the funds without warning or authorization, causing me significant financial hardship. As a direct result of this action, I was unable to meet my financial obligations, leading to my eviction from my residence.

I made the additional escrow payment via Wells Fargo 's website. However, Wells Fargo 's system did not make apply any of the {$4700.00} to additional escrow as I submitted. Instead, Wells Fargo made a payment in the amount of {$1700.00} to the XX/XX/XXXX piti payment. Wells Fargo also made a payment to the principal balance in the amount of {$2900.00}. A total of zero dollars of the {$4700.00} was applied to the additional escrow as I requested. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the {$4700.00} was not applied to 'additional escrow ' and I called Wells Fargo XXXX escrow department. The representative reversed the previous payments and applied them correctly. However, because of the incorrect application of the {$4700.00} that I requested on XX/XX/XXXX, I had to pay a significantly higher mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX. After speaking with a supervisor, it was explained that additional escrow payments that do not satisfy the complete escrow shortage amount are labeled as 'unapplied funds ' and are applied differently. Wells Fargo website does not provide a disclosure explaining this situation to customers."

The bank then wanted to verify my home address, and told me that the change of address was different from my primary home address. When I asked Wells Fargo ( Fraud Department ) representative what address were they showing on my account, they stated that they were not at liberty to give me that information. I eventually went back into my Wells Fargo account online and checked the 'Alert History ' and saw that my account was showing a XXXX , New York address as my new address. I've never lived in XXXX, New York, I live in XXXX, GA. Wells Fargo eventually cancelled the new debit card going to the XXXX , New York address, but were unable to tell me how this happened. 

In addition, I received a text from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2023 that a New XXXX recipient XXXX was added to my account. I do not know anyone by the name XXXX and I immediately went into my account to remove him from XXXX. 

I am writing the CFPB to file a complaint and to also request an investigation, as to how this could possibly have happened. The thought that a new card was being issued with my name, and being sent to a new address disturbs me, because had I not contacted Wells Fargo in time, once the new card arrived at this scammers address, they could have wiped out my entire account ( s ). Any assistance that you can provide would be greatly appreciated."

They were very helpful and after 6 months they offered 6 more. At 12 months they offered 6 more and we declined. We resumed our normal payments. 9 months later, Wells Fargo decided to take our mortgage back to underwriting, stating we might not qualify for the same amount or interest rate. My husband was both very scared about losing our home and upset because we had already resumed payments at the full amount, and had never even been late. Two years later we are still dealing with Wells Fargo. We did everything they asked with underwriting. They change our interest rate. Very unfair. We just dealt with it and let it go until now. Now we are receiving letters stating because of us pausing our mortgage our escrow account is in the negative and we need to write them a check for {$12000.00}. We need help.

3/24/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I'm trying to find out if we have any compensation going back prior to XXXX when Wells Fargo has to pay out for those they hurt by not allowing them to have a loan modification. It was XXXX when our troubles started- and we worked with Wells Fargo on a loan modification for months and months. All we wanted was a lower finance charge so we could afford to stay in our home of 12 years. We went back and forth with them, with them finally telling us they could only help us if we were in default on our loan ( we had been using credit cards to make our house payments, so we would not default ) They said they could only help us if we were 3 months behind in our payments, so we stopped putting our payments on our credit cards, per Wells Fargo 's advice. 
Then, after the 3 months, they declined to modify our loan AGAIN. 
We had excellent credit, aside from owing the credit cards- but because Wells Fargo lied to us, and reneged on their promise to modify our loan, we lost our home of 12 years. We have never recovered emotionally, nor have we been able to purchase a new home. Wells Fargo ruined our lives as we knew it- with fake promises to modify. But it happened just prior to XXXX what can we do now?"

Then around XX/XX/XXXX I started receiving mail from Wells Fargo with odd names on them. Even received a few with my maiden name on them. I called the bank and reported this because I know to open accounts my credit has to be ran and while speaking with the representative noticed that the info used to Create the accounts wasnt even correct. They had my first name with my maiden name ( Ive been married for years ), and also had my year of birth XXXX number off. The email Was also changed to something I didnt recognize. She could not locate where the accounts were created so she routed me to the fraud department where I created a case. They told me the account was closed immediately and recommended I call credit bureau and fraud alert my social, so I did. The bank said they would get back to me within 7 days. I waited and no response from anyone regarding the situation. I called back and left messages and still no response. In XX/XX/XXXX I was scrolling through my old email and noticed I was receiving numerous emails about my wells Fargo account changes. I called wells Fargo again only to find out 2 more accounts were opened. I spoke with fraud department again and created a case. I asked numerous times how can accounts still be getting created with a fraud case open and alert of my social. The lady has no answer but assured me the current two accounts would be closed. I too it upon myself to look up the codes on the account numbers and noticed the accounts were being created around Nevada area. I live in North Carolina. I dont understand how several accounts can be open with my social but when I tried originally, it denied me. To this day I still receive mail with random names from Wells Fargo."

3/24/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Wells Fargo continues to allow debit card transactions to be processed even though my account is in the negative and I keep my debit card locked when there's no funds in the account. Furthermore, the manner in which they post transactions is too confusing for consumers to understand which transactions have already been covered by my deposits and which ones are still pending to be charged a fee given their Confusing "" extra day grace period "". I have a multitude of recurring bills and I work two jobs and I am unable to keep track of all the recurring payments but I should be able to trust the bank not be predatory. If my account is already negative and my card is locked, why do they continue to allow debit card transactions to go through? Just so they can rack up on {$35.00} fees. They charged me 5 {$35.00} overdraft fees in the last 7 days. It would have been more if I had not disputed some of the transactions. I shouldn't have to be monitoring my account this closely given my account was negative and card was locked!"

I saw the approval in my email. They made mobile deposits to my savings account and stated that I needed to send the money back via XXXX gift cards. The explanation was that it would be proven to them that I was who I stated I was due to there being alot of scams and fraud occurring. So they numerous mobile deposits totalling approximately XXXX dollars into my savings. They told me to send the money back via XXXX XXXX I told them that I don't have that app however I do have XXXX. Then they said ok well just return the money via gift cards like XXXX... So I gave all of the money back to them via XXXX gift cards. After that I was told that the loan check was being deposited and to standby.. I waited for that to occur and it never happened. A few days after that my savings account started stating a negative balance.. At that moment I understood I was just scammed. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo to alert them to what happened and they quickly closed that account and open a claim for me on my behalf..

I called to Wells Fargo Costumer Service and the agent to talked to me said that they couldn't get the money from the issuing bank because the Signature on check was wrong and Wells Fargo will try to get the money from the other bank again on XX/XX/XXXX and then they will deposit to me on the following business day, it means, XX/XX/XXXX. 
After that I decided to call the person who give me the check and we both headed to his bank to cancel that check and he would pay me with another one. We get in shock when the agent looked up his account and showed us that the Signature was right and Actually, Wells Fargo had already cashed the check on XX/XX/XXXX!!! I have proof of that! 
So THEY LIED SAYING TO ME 1 ) THE HOLD REASON WAS FOR AN IRREGULAR SIGNATURE ON CHECK ( LIE ) 2 ) THEY WILL TRY TO GET THE MONEY ON XX/XX/XXXX AND WILL DEPOSIT THE MONEY THE FOLLOWING DAY ( IT WAS LIE TOO ) I decided to call Costumers Service again and the agent was rude to me, saying I was lying, that I have to wait because that's the bank policies.

I contacted Wells Fargo Bank NA via its attorneys Attorney Phillip Hasty and Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX regarding the settlement we are entitled to according to the information in this link : https : XXXX, but I have not heard from Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX attorneys regarding my settlement, and I pray and hope you will convince them to send me my settlement check of {>= $1,000,000} in a certified cashier 's check payable to me and my son. Please send me a good lawyer with your Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who will get them to send us our fair settlement today. Thank you. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Another copy of the overview of events is also enclosed. Thank you for your help. 
Sincerely yours, XXXX XXXX XXXX Overview of details of WFBNA 'S illegal foreclosure and eviction of my family Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) illegally evicted us from our home located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia, XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, with the use of deadly force of military weapons aimed at my family, primarily my son, who was the only one home when they arrived. The neighbors saw and witnessed this ugliness too. Thank God my young granddaughter and toddler age nephew and I weren't there to see that corruption. The illegal eviction was led by WFBNA 's real estate agent, XXXX XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX firm who sought to coerce us to sign a document giving up our civil rights to pursue action against them in exchange for stopping the already illegal eviction. ( It is a 7 page document from Wells Fargo Bank NA 's lawyers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX now called XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and was mailed to you. ) Other criminal and hate generated crimes against us included : ( a ) repeatedly denying me a fair FHA loss mitigation and loan modification for years which every FHA homeowner is legally entitled to receive ; ( b ) illegally foreclosing on our home when a legitimate bankruptcy had been filed on our home ( Bankruptcy case # XXXX ). According to reliable legal research and the federal law, any property foreclosed on by a bank or creditor who ignored a bankruptcy filed is supposed to be completely returned to the owner, and the property can never be foreclosed on by that said bank or creditor again after neglecting to honor the bankruptcy filed. Thus, to continue to illegally evict us after ignoring the bankruptcy and to commit fraud on the courts while continuously discrediting and dehumanizing me and my family is not only corruption, but it is just plain evil. 

( c ) They committed fraud on both the federal and state courts to illegally evict us. Even the pink document, the Fulton County sheriff 's entry document, used to evict us had the incorrect address on it, yet WFBNA still continued to illegally evict us under Well Fargo Bank NA 's instructions after we refused to sign the 7 page extortion document which is enclosed.

( d ) They committed a hate crime towards us as they maliciously sought to extort our civil rights when they used excessive deadly force aimed at my family, primarily, my son, when they had military weapons aimed at him threatening to kill him while they were seeking to get him to get us to agree to sign their letter of extortion at the illegal eviction. One of the men dressed as a Fulton County sheriff even sought to goad and provoke my son into a fight as they sought to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXry type weapons aimed at him. 

( e ) This hate crime and all of the stress from years of having to fight WFBNA 'S hatred and corruption towards me and my family has contributed to the decline of my health. It contributed to my not being able to work at my Cobb County public school as a dedicated teacher whereas if I were able to work and enjoy my chosen profession of teaching, I would have been able to earn over hundreds of thousands of dollars teaching during since they started their malicious and systemic and institutionalized hate crimes against me and my family. I was legally entitled to a fair FHA loss mitigation loan modification with no fictitious and erroneous fees held against me, yet they repeatedly refused to do the right thing. I have had to basically fight them as a Pro Se litigant for years as they chose to gain up on me and to dehumanize and disrespect me and my family with their gang of corrupt bully lawyers due to what appears to be their plain old ugly hatred and prejudice against me and mine. 
We have been unable to live in peace since all of these horrible things occurred. We have also had to live as vagabonds gong from hotel to motel to room rental places etc. after they caused our homelessness, and we pray and look forward to your negotiating and helping us to receive our fair settlement of {>= $1,000,000} or more so we may have some solace very soon. They are so evil and wicked that they refused to even allow the eviction judge, Judge Kimberly M. Esmund Adams, to grant a continuance to me in court due to my mothers death from an awful and tragic battle with XXXX in XXXX. If your schedule won't allow you to handle this for us, please let us know someone who is good and trustworthy like yourself who can swiftly get this done for us.

They rearranged my payments also in order to try and get my account deep into the negatives even though I had funds that covered my expenses. So the rearrangement ends up setting me into negatives."

We had a hardship with the loss of my income leaving only his and we struggled with them, fighting with them for well over a year. They took my home not understanding that I had lost my husband and I had gotten sick and wasn't working.

Was recent and that it shouldnt have occurred I would like to have the full interest for the XXXX and XXXX payment be reimbursed when I talk to Wells Fargo on the phone I escalated to it to their next level and they also said thats all they could do is chart is reimburse only {$50.00} of the amount. now knowing there is a lag in the second payment, I have taken care of it on my side but I would like for them to reimburse all the interest that was accrued in the XXXX and XXXX payment."

3/25/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"In XXXX XXXX, I noticed that I had approximately 10 fraudulent transactions on my Wells Fargo checking account spanning from XXXX The charges appeared to be based in CA, but I had been an official resident of XXXX XXXX, TX since XX/XX/XXXX. Two of the fraudulent charges appeared as XXXX and one of them was posted to my WF checking account on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00}. WF helped me dispute the other fraudulent transactions, even the {$340.00} XXXX fraud transaction. When I tried to dispute the {$1300.00}, WF said that it was a valid charge, although my monthly insurance premium is {$160.00}. I contacted XXXX to verify and confirm that my automatic payments to them are set up to come out of my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX checking account on XX/XX/XXXX and that my change of direct deposit request form, signed by me on XX/XX/XXXX was received and processed, which it was. My claim was opened on XXXX  and closed on XX/XX/XXXX however, I had to open a new claim after constantly calling the card claim department to get specific details on what I need to show to prove that the transaction was not authorized by me, and neither was it taken from the legitimate XXXX XXXX XXXX. The reps said they needed a letter from XXXX which state the amount that XXXX charges me and the date it posted in XX/XX/XXXX or my bank statements. They said a letter from XXXX stating that they did not charge the {$1300.00}, but they do not provide such letters. Wells Fargo also recommended making a police report, which I did as well. All of these take time to request and days to receive and I did my best to provide them with what was requested. Most of the reps I spoke with sounded uncertain about a lot of the information that they were giving to me, but I still tried to comply with them. XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed cardclaim@wellsfargo.com my XXXX change of direct deposit request form. I included the initial claim number in my email which was XXXX so that I could have the claim reopened. XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed WF my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX insurance bill/payment summary and my XXXX monthly statement to show the legitimate XXXX payment made on XXXX XXXX, I emailed WF my fraud report number, XXXX, received from the FTC and the same number was used to make a police report with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, TX and the police report number is XXXX. After making calls to them every 2-3 days they informed me that I would have to open a new claim and that I needed to resend all the documentation to the new claim number they would reissue me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I resent my fraud report number XXXX received from the FTC and police report number to cardclaim@wellsfargo.com under the new claim number XXXX. On XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo that the investigation is complete and that a detailed letter was sent by mail. On XXXX when I opened the letter, it said the charges were made by me or someone had my permission. On XX/XX/XXXX, I had called and spoken with a total of 5 Wells Fargo employees and was told that because I do business with XXXX the charge is not considered fraudulent. I politely corrected the employee and said that I had been using the work fraud and fraudulent in regard to the transaction since XXXX, when did the status change to non-fraudulent? I have also asked to have a copy of a card fraud affidavit that I can fill out but none of the employees seemed to know what that was. I had consulted with an attorney, and he said that Wells Fargo should be able to provide the document so that I can sign a sworn statement saying that it is not a charge authorized by myself. I also inquired again why the {$340.00} XXXX fraud charge was cleared by Wells Fargo but not the higher amount? The answers given to me never make sense but it feels like they just don't want to take the loss and would rather pin it on me, which is not fair at all."
3/25/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,Unauthorized XXXX  and XXXX XXXX and online charges
3/25/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"Since XXXX I have been a Wells Fargo customer and a victim of the bank 's previous indiscretions, which have since been rectified through their remediation program. Wells Fargo continues to close consumer accounts improperly without valid justification. I was informed that the risk department closed my XXXX XXXX Propel ( Ending XXXX ) and Business Platinum credit card ( Ending XXXX ) due to "" suspicions of irregular payment behavior and suspected fraud. '' I was told this was because I am making multiple payments within a month, but Wells Fargo never notified me that making more than XXXX payments each month was outside of its standard policies. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX all permit multiple payments ; thus, I had no idea that Wells Fargo regarded this as "" suspicion of fraud. '' I am a frequent foreign traveler who enjoys accumulating credit card points for future trips. If I have made more than four monthly payments, it is because Id rather put the charge on my credit card instead of running the same charge through my debit card and accumulating zero points. Hence, if an unexpected expense has to be paid and I do not have enough available credit, I would make an additional payment to cover the amount to accumulate credit card points. It appears that some employees in the risk department are unaware of the allure of credit card points and overseas travel in todays times. 

Wells Fargo also used a stop payment request from my other bank, XXXX XXXX, to justify the closure of my account, despite the fact that I had phone representatives add notes to my account. The payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX, and after noticing that it did not post quickly, as it regularly does, I called the call center to inquire whether the payment would post that evening. I was somewhat relieved when I was informed that it would be posted because my statement was scheduled to close that evening. I attempted to pay down the balance before it was reported to the credit bureaus. The following morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I observed that the payment had not yet been posted, so I called Wells Fargo again to request that they cancel the payment. Instead, I withdrew the {$1200.00} payment from XXXX XXXX and then deposited it into my Wells Fargo everyday checking account ( ending XXXX ). I was informed that the rep could cancel the payment, and I inquired as to whether it would still be processed through my XXXX account. I was informed that the payment would not be presented to my XXXX account. Monday morning, XX/XX/XXXX, a {$1200.00} payment from Wells Fargo was pending on my XXXX account. Given that I had already deposited the funds into my Wells Fargo account to make the payment, I called XXXX to initiate a stop payment. My XXXX account had pending items that were at risk of not being covered due to the duplicate {$1200.00} payment that was pending. 

A few days later, I checked my Wells Fargo app to discover that my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Limit {$12000.00} ) had been closed and that the Business Platinum card ( Limit {$2500.00} ) was also in the process of being canceled. I was quite outraged because I had previously provided explanations and had phone agents document it ; however, I was still unfairly penalized. Wells Fargo 's risk department marked the tradeline as "" potential fraud, '' and my credit score took a hit in addition to the closure as my average age of account history was reduced. 

I should also mention that I have both personal and business checking accounts ; my monthly personal checking account deposits range from {$18000.00} to {$50000.00}. My monthly business checking balance ranges from {$10000.00} to {$25000.00}. Since Wells Fargo can see my deposits because I do most of my primary banking with them, they incorrectly viewed me as a risk. The average XXXX does not deposit the amount XXXX deposit into Wells Fargo monthly. I contacted the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, who referred the matter back to the Risk department for evaluation, but I was denied reinstatement due to "" Possible Fraud, '' as the Wells Fargo XXXX department termed it. Even though the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX listened to all the phone records supporting my case and supplied facts to the risk department, Wells Fargo still flagged me as a potential fraud. This is incorrect on ALL agreements, and it is a slap in the face from a bank I've been with since XXXX. Today 's Wells Fargo client base is dwindling, and rather than making every effort to maintain long-term, loyal consumers ; the bank is pushing its core foundation away each day. 

I am requesting the reinstatement of my credit cards, as I have not engaged in any fraudulent behavior. I can not tolerate my primary bank closing my credit accounts and falsely accusing me of any wrongdoing. I will fight with every fiber of my being to reject the wrongful accusation they have imposed on me. XXXX pretty sure there are others who have faced wrongful accusations and improper closures, which signals a problem within the bank itself."

3/26/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"Wells Fargo, in their gross negligence, was effectively responsible for a wire transfer fraud. Wells Fargo allowed TWICE an inbound wire transfer to enter an account whose name did NOT match the name of the recipient of that account. This gross negligence led to me losing money to scammers when I was trying to pay closing costs for a house I was looking to purchase. 

I visited a Wells Fargo branch to try to resolve it and after initial resistance, one of their agents reached out to their investigation department to make a report, but I never saw any response. They would not offer me much help because they claimed that I did not have an account with them ( I have a credit card account with them, but not a bank account ). This makes no sense ; not having an account with Wells Fargo does not give them the license to allow obvious fraud to take place on their watch. 

Ultimately, I only received a partial recall of my stolen money. I am still short {$400.00} from Wells Fargo 's negligence. I need Wells Fargo to refund the {$400.00} remaining from the wire recall I did."

3/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/23 Wells Fargo notified my son XXXX XXXX that there was fraudulent activity on his account. My son 's account is connected to mine so the bank has been talking to me about this issue as well. There were 4 transactions in question all on XX/XX/23 and originated in the XXXX area. We live in Oregon and my son XXXX lives at home with me. The first transaction was XXXX for XXXX XXXX and was immediately declined by Wells Fargo as fraudulent. The same day a transaction in the same area for XXXX XXXX was made for XXXX and was for some reason paid by Wells Fargo. That day there were also two charges to XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. For some reason Wells Fargo paid these charges but then flagged them for fraud and called my son to let him know. My son confirmed that these were not his charges. The next day Wells Fargo called back to say they would not reimburse my son because their "" investigation '' had "" proven '' these charges to be my son 's. When I talked to Wells Fargo I was told because whoever had the credit card had my sons address then the charges must be his. I knew these were not my sons charges and began my own investigation. What I found out is that Wells Fargo had not done any investigation at all. I was able to track down the XXXX XXXX in question ( which again is in XXXX ) and talk to the store manager. She looked up the transaction and found that the person who made the XXXX transaction online actually then came into the store in XXXX and picked up the merchandise. She had the person on video tape and decribed him as an XXXX american man. My son is XXXX and XXXX and live in Oregon. The name given was XXXX XXXX with an email address of XXXX and a phone # of XXXX XXXX XXXX. None of these are connected with my son. I was told by XXXX XXXX to file a police report. I filed a report with the XXXX XXXX police department and they were able to confirm that this man on the tape was not my son. I spent the next month on the phone with Wells Fargo trying to give them the police report number ( which they never took ) and explaining that a person in XXXX was on film picking up merchandise. After hours spent on the phone and numerous claim numbers and representatives, Wells Fargo finally returned the money from the XXXX XXXX transaction. Now another month later we are still trying to get my son 's money back from the XXXX transactions. At our local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, both the manager XXXX and their banking specialist XXXX have told me over the phone several times they they know this is fraud but that they personally can not help us as it has to be handled by the claims escalation people. I have talked to numerous claims escalation people at Wells Fargo who have said they were helping and would call back but they never do. I was told by someone named XXXX that XXXX had to provide proof by XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX would get his money back. On XX/XX/XXXX I got an email that since I had provided no more information they were closing the investigation- remember they would not take the police report or video evidence from me. I called to complain and this time got XXXX who said she was handling my complaint now and it would be resolved on XX/XX/XXXX. On the XXXX I got an email that no resolution was found and it would be 90 days before I would hear anything. I called and asked to talk to XXXX and was told she was on the phone and would call me back. She never did. I called two days later and insisted on talking to her. They told me that XXXX was out of the office and that she had closed our claim on the XXXX and a different claims agent had opened a new claim. It has now been almost 2 and 1/2 months and still Wells Fargo has not returned my son 's money nor have they provided us with a reliable time line or any documentation on how they can prove these were my son 's charges. It seems pretty obvious that four transactions taking place on the same day originating from the East coast and flagged for fraud would all be related. Also they fact that they did not pay the XXXX transaction and eventually returned the XXXX XXXX transaction is a fairly good indication that these charges are all related and all fraud. Since a person claiming to be XXXX XXXX actually picked up items at a XXXX XXXX in person there is proof that my son 's debit information was being used without his knowledge or consent. The two XXXX charges are for food deliveries. XXXX does not deliver in our area and my son was at home/school/work those days and did not receive any food deliveries. While my branch continues to tell me how sorry they are that Wells Fargo is not giving my son his money back on what they admit is clearly fraud, they continue to do nothing. I am not giving up on this- my son is a college student who works hard and this is his money. My belief is that Wells Fargo makes it so hard to get your money back that the average person just gives up. Im sure Wells Fargo saves a lot of money that way.

3/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,Wells Fargo basically messed up my account with letting somebody empty my account out due to fraud never informed me or nothing
3/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On Sunday, XX/XX/ after XXXX XXXX, I went to the Wells Fargo Bank ATM machine on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA to withdraw {$20.00} cash. My positive balance before the withdrawal was {$300.00}. At the ATM machine, I saw a message that there is no receipt available, withdrew {$20.00}, and removed my debit card from the ATM. I knew my ending positive balance should be {$280.00} even though I did not get a receipt. 

As soon as I was finished withdrawing the {$20.00}, a XXXX XXXX male ( possibly XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that was behind me, immediately told me that I forgot my receipt and at the same time, he came next to me and told me, let me help you get the receipt. He told me to put in the debit card back into the ATM machine to get the receipt, but the ATM machine was having problems receiving my debit card, and the guy tied to help me push the debit card into the ATM machine. I was finally able to enter my PIN number, but I made sure this guy didnt see the PIN number that I was entering. 

When my account was accessed, the guy started to touch the ATM machine screen, and I didnt feel uncomfortable with what he was doing so I told him, no, no, its okay, and I quickly removed my debit card and left the ATM machine with no more money coming out. Later, when I checked my Well Fargo App on my phone, I saw that instead of having a positive balance of {$280.00}, my account was showing a negative balance, - {$660.00}. I also noticed there were more transactions that I didnt do myself and I didnt know this happened to me. I only needed {$20.00} cash and did not take nor authorized {$950.00} taken out my account in three transactions which are for {$800.00} plus {$100.00} plus {$50.00}. 

I initially filed a claim over the phone with Wells Fargo Fraud Department the same day and was given Claim # XXXX and instructed to wait 10 days for an investigation to be complete. However, I received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank stating that the case is closed with my claim being denied because I or someone who had my permission received {$950.00}, but that is not true. The ATM machine should have a video and audio recording to show that I only received {$20.00} cash and no more money, but apparently Wells Fargo Bank did not do a proper investigation of what happened during and after using the ATM machine on Sunday, XX/XX/. 

Throughout the time I was waiting for the Wells Fargo Fraud Department investigation to be over, I spoke to a few other Wells Fargo Bank personnel when I got my new debit card and went in person to activate it, and then on Monday, XX/XX/, I was inquiring over the phone how to appeal the decision Wells Fargo Bank made to decline my claim based on incorrect assumptions and implying that I stole my own money. I cant believe the bank is saying this, and this is 100 % not true. The last person I spoke to in the Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Department on XXXX XXXX XXXX, told me that I can not appeal the banks decision, and I can not resubmit a new claim for the same transactions a claim was already submitted against. 

I dont understand how the police can get the bank to give me my money back. Why would Wells Fargo Bank let someone take more than {$300.00} from an ATM machine, and why allow more money to come out of an ATM machine if the available balance is less and no cash advance is requested? Dont they dispense money in {$20.00} increments, so why {$950.00}? How can the bank allow their ATM machine to keep working after Ive removed my debit card? And why isnt the bank fixing this process and giving me back my money when they allowed available and unavailable money to be stolen so easily? 

It turned out that Wells Fargo Bank not only allowed my initial available positive balance of {$280.00} to be taken out, but Wells Fargo Bank later took my entire Social Security retirement of {$750.00} that was automatically deposited into my account, to cover their loss and additional bank charges totaling {$100.00} for three overdraft fees of {$35.00} each. Wells Fargo Bank is now saying that I owe them {$18.00}. Now Im out a total of {$1000.00} with {$950.00} stolen, and {$100.00} in additional bank charges ( see below embedded attachments ). 

Please, I need someone to help me resolve this issue with Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Department as soon as possible so I can get my money back for my rent and living expenses. Please help me. Thank you"

I've been unemployed during this time and had to rely on driving XXXX while attending grad school. Wells Fargo recently XXXX the ability for my account to overdraft which has made my situation even worse by bouncing ACH and debit transactions on things I need and rely on. 

The final straw was today when I saw that a company that I put a stop payment on charged my account twice in the past week. I reported the transactions as unauthorized as the company took money out of my account using fraudulent checks and the agent, whom I could barely understand told me that he would have to close the account ( I think he meant to say restrict online access to my account ) and that he can transfer me to the department that can have me re-access the account, however, I was transferred to the wrong agent and the agent transferred me to another fraud agent. The second fraud agent said that there was no claim made on my account and that she would have to make one, she offered that I could stop the payment or go into a process that would close the account - however after informing her that I will leave Wells Fargo if im charged a stop payment fee I was put on hold and told that I won't be able to put a stop payment on the payments, even with a fee and that I would have to go into whatever process she was talking about. Frustrated, I was sent over to an escalated support agent who was just as bad as the first two, I further declined for them to continue the claim and told her that I will leave Wells Fargo next month. I was told that the department responsible for giving me access back on the account was closed and that I would have to call tomorrow. 

I do not know if my deposits will hit the account tomorrow, I do not know If I would have access when I call, as I no longer trust this bank."

I schedule to my bank XXXX XXXX  to make a payment on XX/XX/XXXX ; I checked the payment done by XXXX XXXX  and I read the statement done to Wells Fargo on the date scheduled, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Suprisingly, on XX/XX/XXXX, i received an email from Wells Fargo saying thet my statement mentionned above is due. 
I respond back that my payment transaction shows on my account with XXXX XXXX that was done on XX/XX/XXXX. After that I called XXXX XXXX to confirm that my payment was done as shown on my account, they said yes was done, maybe Wells Fargo did not clear the payment. 
I called Wells Fargo, I told them that my payment was done by my bank, they said they did not receive any check, to wait until Friday XX/XX/XXXX to receive the payment check. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the next statement, where I noticed I was charged with a late fee {$25.00} and a charge named total interest {$40.00}. Considering my payment done on time, XX/XX/XXXX, show my wright attitude as a customer, the late fee and other penalty charge is for people not willing to pay, or showing a consistent intention to pay late, I alloways pay full and on time."

3/27/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"My problem is two-fold. It involves an account with Wells Fargo which is joint with my mother XXXX XXXX XXXX, and a separate account at Wells Fargo which is in my name only. The more serious of the two is the joint account with my mother. 
On XX/XX/XXXX a fraudulent debit was made from my account ( not joint account ) for {$65.00} to a XXXX XXXX. A second appeared on XX/XX/XXXX as a recurring payment to XXXX for XXXX. I called customer service when I discovered the fraudulent charge and specifically asked if I needed to do anything further to secure my accounts. The answer was "" no, we have taken care of anything and the money will be refunded. '' I received a "" purchase return '' from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, a large wire transfer of {$8100.00} was sent to someone by the name of XXXX XXXX who also had a Wells Fargo bank account. I agree I was scammed out of the money. A legitimate Wells Fargo representative was on the phone with me as the funds were being withdrawn by a scammer who knew the Wells Fargo script. This is when I realized I was scammed. They knew immediately, but claimed the funds could not be retrieved. The amount of trouble trying to communicate with their investigation department was outrageous! I was shifted from investigative dep artment to another without anyone providing any information. I was told and my mother was sent a letter indicating funds were authorized and that her debit card was used. 
Finally, after numerous phone calls, I got a manager who told me XXXX XXXX was a plumber and grilled me as to whether we knew him. Neither I nor my mother know anyone by the name of XXXX XXXX. We each have a home. Mine is in XXXX, my mother a home in XXXX. Neither of us had any work done in our home by anyone. 
I was on vacation overseas and could not file a police report until XX/XX/XXXX. A detective XXXX XXXX can be reached at XXXX Ext. XXXX was assigned to my case.I have also contacted the XXXX. My ID XXXX is XXXX and contacted the Federal Trade Commission. 
The last Wells Fargo investigator I spoke with told me while I was overseas, I had to go into a Wells Fargo branch to get any other information. On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited my local branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NJ, where I opened my account and spoke with the manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX. He looked into my account and had no idea of my situation. He attempted calling the fraud department from his Branch Office and after roughly half an hour, the call was either dropped or the person hung up on him. He saw my frustration, as this was my experience all along. He sent an email to escalate my case to the "" Resolution Team. '' I was told I would be contacted in 1 to 2 business days. I was contacted and told my story to the supervisor and I would have a response in 10 to 14 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with "" XXXX '' who explained the funds were immediately withdrawn by XXXX XXXX and the bank could not retrieve the funds. She said it was "" unfortunate you were scammed, but the bank is not responsible and doesn't have to replace the funds stolen. '' During the conversation, I explained that XXXX XXXX has an account at Wells Fargo. She claimed my case was still open by the bank investigators. 
I explained when the orginal theft took place from my sole account on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I asked if I had to do anything to protect my accounts. Her response was, if you feel uncomfortable at any time, you can request the change. I feel in multiple ways Wells Fargo has been negligent. First, they had a chance to help me to change passwords,, debit cards, etc. and instead assured me my accounts were safe! 
Trying to deal with the fraud department was a nightmare in itself. I had representatives who could not transfer me to a U.S. Wells Fargo representative and were in the dark as to how to help me with fraud. It tooks hours for me to try and get anyone, then the calls would drop. The U.S. representatives refused to give me any information until I got a manager, who was limited in what she knew or could say.

The investigators were no better. I felt Wells Fargo sets up customers to become frustrated in hopes they will give up their fight to get their money back.

The final straw was when the Branch manager was hung up on. I was told by "" XXXX '' I could once again file another Fraud Claim, which I will be doing very soon. 
I requested to speak with XXXX 's manager and am expecting a call in the next few days. 
I feel Wells Fargo has failed me at every turn and then had the audacity to accuse my and my mother of authorizing a wire transfer for "" work done. ''"

In fact, two agreed payments had been made and the third and final modification payment was in process. They stated that although they made a mistake by selling my home, it's in California and the sale could not be reversed. I was forced out of my home without notice and suffered major financial damages. Wells Fargo has avoided any consideration after I have pursued justice in this matter several times. Wells Fargo has absolutely no Conscience and is a very dangerous entity for any community.

During this call he indicated he was mad that I had filed with the CFPB. He again refused to allow me to provide evidence of the illegal and abusive actions of WF. He stated repeatedly that he would decide and it was clear his animosity would result in no reparations in spite of the rightfulness of my claim. He was dismissive, rude, uncaring and abusive and indicated I am a liar. He refused to listen or discuss my case. It is very clear he is only marshaling facts to support denial of rightful restitution to my family. 

I am formally requesting that WF get a unbiased decision maker who is not abusive, not smug pedantic, patronizing or grossly biased. 

I further am complaining that WF are the ADMITTED bad actors AND YET THEY ARE IN CONTROL AND CONTINUING THEIR UNETHICAL BUSINESS AS USUAL ignore, abuse, steal from their own clients, I want an unbiased person who is not abusive, who cares and as XXXX XXXX promised will make whole all us victims. 

He also screamed at me when he thought I might be recording him. He stated only he could record me. He is wrong. But he was very concerned there would be a record of his unethical treatment of me. Further, he only ever called me he admitted because of my complaint, This is a new concern given XXXX 's demonstrated biased and abusive behavior, he has demonstrated personal amimus against me personally, refuses to allow me ANY input or to testify or present evidence ( that I have in audio and emails TO WF agents ) has essentially called me a liar, screamed at me for filing a complaint, lied about who he works for, and stated he made final decision already but couldnt "" tell me ''. I again begged to have input with the recordings, emails and previous CFPB detailed complaints I made at the time proving illegal dual trackingand other egregious abuses, XXXX XXXX clearly only has ine objective ; to deny as many reparation claims as possible and he marshals or creates anything to support this conclusion.

3/28/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"I recently received a lawsuit summons from Wells Fargo where I do not feel they followed proper protocol prior to the lawsuit as well as other consumer rights. I am afraid they will leave me in a state where I am unable to pay for my utilities and mortgage due to their acts. I would like to go over the history I have with Wells Fargo. I had been called into the local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX CA for a issue my parents were experiencing when trying to refinance their home. They needed to improve their credit before the refi could occur. The loan officer had asked if I would be willing to cosign on the auto loan for their XXXX in order to get their bills up to date. I was in the process of trying to purchase a home so I was very apprehensive to put my name on any new loan. The branch officer had promised me that their refi for the home was already underway and approved for three months out so the longest the loan would be out was the three months. I believed the loan officer and co-signed on the refinance. As I was leaving the branch officer told me as part of the auto loan they also issue out a credit card. I never applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo and had not requested this but I was told after all papers were signed that I needed to have a existing relationship with them in order to have the auto loan. I was very young and did not understand what the meant but I assumed I would not need to worry as the auto loan would be out of my name in three months. After the three months, I noticed that the loan wasnt removed. This caused great distress between the relationship between my parents and I. I called Wells Fargo to ask them how to remove myself, at that time I was told the loan was not actually a co-sign loan, I was the sole person on the loan. I would like to request Wells Fargo pull phone conversations as I called numerous times on this very upset as they agreement was went into fraudulently. At one point, the auto loan payments were late which impacted my credit score which caused a pause on purchasing a home. I am stating this background to state Wells Fargo is very shady in their business practices. 
The credit card site for Wells Fargo is very confusing. You need to log into one place to check your balance, then another to pay the bill and the user id and password requirements are different. This caused it to be very confusing on when something was due and how to pay as I was locked out many times. If Wells Fargo pulls their logs, they will be able to see this. Because it was so hard to get into, I would list out months in the future to pay, I believe it only let you schedule six months out so I would go in, schedule a future payment, then only log in when I needed to do this again. 
At one point, Wells Fargo would not allow me to access their site. My recollection had that I had scheduled payments out til XXXX so I went in XXXX but was no longer able to access the site. I tried to reset using my card info but my account was not found. I had not gotten paper statements and could not get through when trying to call so I waited to try to figure out what was going on. I received a letter stating my account was closed which I believe was due to non-use as my goal had only been to pay off the credit card. The papers I was given show a agreement, but this is not a agreement I ever received. 
I was always willing to pay in payment as I was but I could not afford the lump sum payment they were demanding due to closing the account. I felt like I was always paying the card on time, I would have continued to pay but I did not have the funds to pay in full as I was already into a debt consolidation agreement where the payments were really high. The Wells Fargo card was my oldest card, when they closed the account this impacted my score negatively as I had no other credit at the time. I am still trying to recover my credit from that initial closure, they did not give me the opportunity to let me know why the account was being closed. I have been told by XXXX XXXX ; accounts get closed if you do not use within a year which is why I am assuming Wells Fargo closed mine since I was paying. 
Due to the debt consolidation, I became aware that when a account is past due, you will get a collection notice that offers a way to pay the debt so I was waiting for this to try to settle the account. Wells Fargo never gave me the opportunity to do this as the next step was them filing the suit. I would like to request a payment plan, but I would also like the court to consider how the credit card was obtained, and the shady business practices Wells Fargo has performed. I have been so incensed by it that I have stated in in social media to try to get them to contact me. Calling them does not help as the people who work there say they can not speak for a branch and the branch has closed. I trusted Wells Fargo to be honest and their actions have directly impacted my credit history. As stated, I am willing to pay what I owe as I always was, but I do believe I deserve compensation for the way they unlawfully obtained my business and negatively impacted my credit score. There is no way for me to truly know how much I owe due to their faulty log in system. I do not feel like Wells Fargo is providing me the option to pay in payments as credit cards usually do but instead will only take lump sums as they did with the initial closing of the account and now with the lawsuit. I can not afford this. There is interest that has been added due to how they are doing this. Had they kept my account open, this would have been paid now in the monthly payments."
3/28/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"The lies and deceit from Wells Fargo are unending. It seems as though every other day they create financial fictions regarding me and my checking-related, Social Security XXXX account. 

It is grotesque in the way Wells Fargo abuses and steals from its physically weakest and poorest clients, such as myself. 

I still have my brain, my excellent education, all the time I need to devote and an absolute refusal to be defeated until my last breath. 

Wells Fargo has an established history of engaging in this exact financial fraud. 
It has an established history of engaging in financial fraud AGAINST ME PERSONALLY, for which it was forced to pay me compensation. I have definitive evidence of Wells Fargo 's current financial fraud against me. A multinational corporation ( XXXX ) has confirmed my statements and claims. 

This is the fourth complaint in less than one month. Each complaint is based in the previous one but they all have independent causes of action. 

My previous three complaints listed here contain the information and evidence relevant to this complaint. 

XXXX. Filed XX/XX/23 XXXX XXXX. Filed XX/XX/23 XXXX XXXX. Filed XX/XX/23 XXXX XXXX. Current complaint All previous complaints are identified as open but it appears that WF has already made decisions against me and plans to take back money - two XXXX charges - that were : A. wrongfully and falsely debited to my account B. then withdrawn - pending debits dropped off account ( Though the overdraft charge remained and WF later assigned that overdraft to an unrelated transaction. ) C. WF then reinstated those charges 5 days later. 
D. Then, in response to my complaints with the CFPB - the funds were provisionally credited. 
Evidence of all of the above is provided with the previous three CFPB complaints. 

Now - guess what- NOW THEY ARE REVERSING THEIR PROVISIONAL CREDIT - claiming I didn't provide a response to their request. 

WF made no such requests to me... And completely ignored the statements made by the merchant- for which I have provided evidence - that they never consented to these transactions. 

On Friday morning XX/XX/23, I received an early morning phone call and voice mail message from XXXX or XXXX- a WF Executive XXXX. I called her back during her working hours but she never returned my call- nor did she return my call today, Monday, XX/XX/23. 

That day, I received three separate envelopes in the USPS from WF stating that they needed more time to make any determination. No requests were made of me to assist them with their investigation. 
All of these will be attached as evidence. 

Two copies of the same letter - regarding CFPB complaint # XXXX ending in XXXX. 
Stated that they needed more time. 

It was signed by XXXX XXXX - Executive Specialist. 

Why is WF allowed for its employees and executives, even within a formal complaint process- to have their names hidden from the complainant? 

The other letter - regarding CFPB - complaint # 2 - ending in XXXX Also said they needed more time and was also signed by XXXX XXXX. 

Today, I received a letter from the Claims Assistance Center- WITH NO NAME OR SIGNATURE IDENTIFYING THE SENDER. 

It says, "" We have completed our research of your inquiry about charges to your account. 
Because we did not receive information we requested from you, we based our decision on the information available. '' MORE LIES!!! 

No request for information or assistance was ever communicated to me in any form by Wells Fargo. 

It continues, "" We found the charges were made by you or someone who had your permission., '' The two original transactions were never completed by XXXX 's system - meaning no product or service was ever purchased. 

In my previous complaints, I have provided definitive proof of this fact from myself and XXXX. It was only WF that put the charges through my account. 

The letter continues, "" As a result, the provisional credit previously issued to you in the amount of {$380.00} will be deducted from your account ending in XXXX, 10 business days from the date of this letter on XXXX. Please consider your claim closed. '' So lets review the history of these charges : XXXX. 
XXXX - Two charges attempted to purchase XXXX services. Neither transaction is successfully completed by XXXX but WF debits both against my account. 
XXXX. Despite the charges still pending- I am assigned an overdraft fee. 
XXXX. Later, that overdraft fee us assigned to a previous ( XXXX ) transaction. 
( My earlier complaints provide definitive evidence that before and after the XXXX transaction they're were sufficient funds in my account. Only when WF improperly debited my account for the XXXX charges did it become negative. ) XXXX. The pending XXXX charges drop off my account in response to my complaints. 
XXXX. The overdraft fee remains. 
XXXX. Days later - WF reintroduced those same two XXXX charges- this time - providing falsified bank records stating that these charges cleared immediately on XXXX and were never in a pending state. 
XXXX. In response to my further complaints - these two charges are provisionally credited to my account. 
NOW - XXXX. I am notified by letter that despite many letters stating they require more time- they have already decided that either I made these charges or gave permission for them. This is despite my evidence from myself and XXXX stating explicitly, that neither transaction was successfully completed- so no service or product was ever purchased in these two transactions. 

WF goes on to LIE that they requested info from me and I didn't respond. 
WF decides to reverse the provisional credit, 10 days from now. ( Despite repeatedly stating they aren't finished investigating ). 

The letter asks me to contact them if I disagree with their decision but given their lie after lie and one falsified banking record after another - there is no finding an honest resolution with WF. 

So we have XXXX charges attempted but explicitly evidenced as not completed Nevertheless, XXXX. XXXX charges to my account XXXX. XXXX charges dropped from my account XXXX. XXXX charges put back in my account with the claim they were always there. 
XXXX. XXXX charges provisionally credited XXXX. Notice of WF intent to withdraw provisional credit and reddit my account from the original two XXXX charges. 

Enough is enough- the CFPB must step in Now before this insane fiction and deception and theft from my account can continue. 

All of this is simply too ridiculous. It strains all attempts at reasonable comprehension - fortunately I have and have provided absolute definitive proof of ALL OF THIS If your agency will not step in, then I must contact my senators and in particular, given the purpose of the CFPB, I must reach out to Senator XXXX XXXX 's office."

3/28/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I had contacted Wells Fargo in XXXX to request a COVID payment deferral for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the company again to inform them that I was able to start making payments again starting XXXX. During this time, I only received a letter stating that I needed to call them by the end of XXXX to inform them if I could start making payments again. I called to pay my mortgage over the phone, as I usually do, on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, and I received a prompt that stated that I owed {$0.00} for the month of XXXX. Concerned, I spoke with a representative who stated that I actually owed {$2400.00} to keep the mortgage current and avoid foreclosure. When I asked why we had not been contacted regarding how much we owe, and why it wasn't on the telephone prompt to pay, I was told that it was likely because the company "" wanted me to call and speak with someone about it ''. My husband and I were able to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time I was told I would not owe XXXX 's payment and that payments would start again in XXXX. The representative I spoke with informed me that the underwriters had put in a request just an hour prior to my calling for my 2 most recent tax returns, to fill out a mortgage assistant application and XXXX recent pay stubs. I was also informed that the "" XXXX deferral case had been removed ''. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was being sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. When I called and asked why, they said it was normal for mortgage companies to sell mortgages and they did it all the time. I asked if this would affect my credit, they said they were unsure. They also stated that they were unable to tell me about the transfer in services until after the letter was mailed on XX/XX/, meaning my loan was being transferred prior to making the {$2400.00} payment to bring the account current. I called and added my husband as an authorized third party on the XXXX as well so he could call and ask questions about our mortgage. He was informed that we did not have to fill out the mortgage assistance application or send in other financial information at that time. I called right after he spoke to them and was told the same thing. Meanwhile, we have received 2 letters requesting financial documents and the mortgage assistance applications. The most recent one was sent on XX/XX/23. I have been on the phone with Wells Fargo almost daily to ask why the three months ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) were not deferred as our previous deferment had been processed and why those three payments were not simply moved to the end of the loan period. Nobody has been able to give me an answer other than telling me that I owed them 2 months worth of payments to qualify for those payments to be moved to the end of the loan. I was never contacted about owing 2 payments, not by phone and not by letter. I also keep getting letters stating that the deferral is being processed now for the month of XXXX. When I spoke with someone on Friday, XX/XX/23, they told me I still owe XXXX 's payment, they weren't sure why I was told I didn't, I still need to fill out assistant applications and that the loan was current. I asked to speak with a manager as every single person I spoke with would make little comments such as "" this makes no sense '' or "" I'm not sure how this came to be ''. I spoke with a manager on Friday, I can not remember her name, and we were disconnected but when I called back there was a note on my account stating it was "" under review ''. Prior to being disconnected, she informed me that it would have been that my account was delinquent. I told her I was literally just informed that I was not by the previous agent, to which she responded "" Well I can't just trust your verbage on it ''. I reminded her that she had my account pulled up in front of her, supposedly, and that she could determine if I had missed a payment ( Which I NEVER have ) and she said "" I still can't tell if you did or didn't. '' I did receive a call yesterday and today from XXXX XXXX, stating my account is still under review. In the meanwhile, I am unsure if I owe XXXX 's payment, my loan is being transferred to XXXX  and I still have no idea why my deferral was not completed, reviewed or discussed with me prior to all of this and which months the {$2400.00} covered. I decided to send a complaint as I have been made aware of Wells Fargo 's numerous legal issues and the mishandling of loans."

Furthermore it is stated in the documents sent to me that while in forbearance no further foreclosure action will take place. Proceding with any more foreclosure activity based on a hearing that in itself Violated Federal Law which gives no credability to the results of that hearing, is knowingly pursuing an illegal foreclosure."
3/29/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"At XXXXXXXX XXXX  on XXXX  I received a text message from Wells Fargo asking if I authorized a purchase at XXXX. I did not respond to the text as I was driving my children to school at the time. I then received two phone calls from a XXXX, both of which I ignored. I then XXXX  the number, verified that it was in fact Wells Fargo customer service and before I could return the call, the same number called again. I answered and was asked to verify my identity because the bank believed someone making fraudulent charges on my account. I was sent a another text message and the agent asked me to read the number I received. I have been a Wells Fargo customer for almost a decade and I had previously been asked to verify my identity in that manner, so I provided the information. I was asked to do this as the agent was purportedly disputing each charge, so I believe I read out at least 3 different verification numbers. 

The agent then requested that I change my online password so that I could prevent further fraud, which I believed I was complying with by texting CANCEL and my current password to the number provided. Finally, the agent stated that I needed to approve a wire transfer to protect the remaining funds in my account, at which point I became suspicious and added my husband to the call. We requested to speak to a supervisor, the agent then became agitated. We terminated the call and then immediately called the same number backwhere we were informed that we were never actually speaking to Wells Fargo and the agent was likely a scammer who was spoofing the customer service number. 

Our call to Wells Fargo began at XXXX where the fraud was discovered immediately, the accounts were frozen and a request for the return of the wire transfer was initiated. The wire transfer was made to a XXXX XXXX, and included bank information and location. According to bank records, the wire transfer was initiated at XXXX and the fraud was discovered and REPORTED at XXXX. I then visited a branch IN PERSON to transfer the frozen accounts over to new accounts. I did everything expected and required to report an ACTIVE fraud that was occurring on my account. I have provided documentation showing when the unauthorized recipient was added as a wire transfer recipient and when the wire began. At the time the accounts were froze, closed and transferred, the funds were still in the account. 

Less than one hour passed between the initiation of the wire transfer and the report of the fraud, and yet Wells Fargo was unable to terminate the transfer of funds, or contact the receiving bank to inform them of the fraud. I received confirmation of my fraud claim at XXXX, almost TWO HOURS after the fraud was reported. I was also informed by an agent that the funds were not requested back from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for FOUR HOURS, at which time XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX no longer had the funds to return. 

Furthermore, despite the closure of the account where the wire transfer was initiated, Wells Fargo ALLOWED the funds to be wired from the NEW accountfailing to protect the account from the EXACT fraud that was being reported IN REAL TIME. 

The fraud claim was denied on XX/XX/XXXX and I immediately filed an appeal with Wells Fargo, as well as a police report with the XXXX Police Department, an IC3 Complaint with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, and a formal Consumer Complaint Against Wells Fargo for mishandling the IMMEDIATE reporting of wire fraud resulting in the loss of {$23000.00}. 

The documents attached are as follows : the first doc is evidence that a wire transfer recipient was added ( fraudulently ) @ XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This includes the person 's name and XXXX XXXX  XXXX Account information. The second doc is my phone records showing that the call I received was from a Wells Fargo number which was being spoofed by the fraudster -- I was on the phone for 49 minutes, hung up and then immediately called Wells Fargo back to report that I had been scammed. The third doc is proof of the call to Wells Fargo at XXXX. I immediately reported what was happening and my accounts were frozen. The fourth doc is from Wells Fargo, acknowledging my fraud claim at XXXX -- almost two hours after I called them. I was later told by an agent that it took them FOUR hours to request the money back from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, where it had been fraudulently transferred and at that point, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX no longer had the funds. The account detail for 90 days document shows that when I froze and closed my account, ALL of the funds were still there and were transferred over. The account detail "" all transactions '' shows that the funds were transferred to the new account and then removed from the NEW account, despite the fact that the fraud had been reported and the previous accounts were closed."

I am not sure what I am really supposed to do. I have files to support my claims and will forward them on request. 

Wells Fargo BankHas failed to close a CD I opened years ago. I have submitted proper paperwork and have copies which are not to be included in this complaint by CFPB guidelines. Wells Fargo completed an "" investigation '' and failed to refer to two of the three facts stated in my complaint. Additionally, they did not request copies of the paperwork submitted XX/XX/XXXX from their branch office and by their branch office. 

Wells Fargo states in their response that I need to return to the branch office for assistance. Three sentences later the Wells Fargo response states that the banker was not able to proceed with the applicable form. I have a copy of said form completed by XXXX XXXX Phone XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX Which he took to the back of the bank and was supposed to have faxed to the back office. And returned to me stating he did fax it to the back office. 

Obviously XXXX XXXX did not fax the form that was completed by him on his computer XXXX while the back office was on the speaker of my cell phone directing him how to complete the form. 

Additionally, not addressed in the response from Wells Fargo is the fact that I opened a CD account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time a form was forwarded to Wells Fargo to transfer all funds to said account. As of XX/XX/XXXX these funds have yet to be transferred. I also have a copy of that form also which by XXXX statement I am not to attach to this complaint. 

I continue to be frustrated with Wells Fargo Bank and their flagrant denial to close this account. Wells Fargo 's banking practices are why I am, and have been trying, to close all accounts with them. 

Agin, because the proper paperwork was completed on XX/XX/XXXX and was supposed to have been faxed by a lying Wells Fargo banker with a bad attitude. I request to be compensated of lost interest from XX/XX/XXXX to present.

3/29/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Respected Officials, WellsFargo has closed the case XXXX which was opened to make them accept {$12.00} as account fees. They have closed it saying that no fees are required because I have fulfilled their need. However, they have attempted to deposit cheque sent as compensation into my account despite the fact that I have stopped payment on it. 

Now they are charging {$12.00} as fees for that from me. 

If it was a wellsfargo cheque that had been stopped by me due to their reply, they must not deposit it into my account and charge fees. 

The following deposited checks have been returned unpaid. As a result, we have deducted the following amount {$12.00} from your account XXXX.

I wanted to know if I was XXXX of their victim to the abusive or negligent practices described by the CFPB. 

I reach out to Wells Fargo about this, At first I was told they couldn't even find that I had a mortgage with them. Which I had for years. I gave them the property address and they told me, They never saw that there was a mortgage on that property. Even under this account you can see how many complaints I file will CFPB against wells fargo throughout the years. Then I was told if I didn't have my account number they could not help me.

Then I was told to look for website online, only they was unsure what that really could be. Then I am told wait to see if I get a letter about this. I already had moved from that location a few years ago. 

It appeared that they keep giving me the run around and nobody looks into it.. I can not even get a straight answer from them.

3/30/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I contact Wells Fargo regarding the card ending in XXXX to be removed as an authorized user on the account because of an alarming XXXX alert that the card limit had been increased by {$2000.00} to bring the credit line up to {$5000.00}. To my horror, I was informed that I am actually a joint owner, which I not only have not been aware of but was told in text messages from the other joint owner I can submit as proof both recently and from years prior where I am told that he only ever added me as an authorized user. I had to fight to get the case escalated to a Wells Fargo Executive Office Case Specialist XXXX XXXX who confirmed that I was a joint owner and sent me a document I allegedly signed in 2012. However, I have no recollection of this and would submit that my signature was forged by the joint owner I was living with at the time. 

The XXXX closed my case without even speaking to me so that I could provide this information. Further, his grounds for closing are contradictory to what is stated in the document my signature was likely forged on. XXXX stated : "" Unfortunately we are unable to remove a joint owner from the account as the account was established as a joint account and can not be changed to sole ownership. '' However, the document used to add me as a joint owner reads "" request to add a joint cardholder to your existing credit card account ending in XXXX, '' confirming that the account was in fact not established as a joint account but rather amended after the account was already established. Further, the document used to add me does not state anywhere that it is an irrevocable action, that the joint owner to be added can not be removed, that the account is to be re-established as a joint one, or that the joint owner will be secondary holder and forever at the mercy of the primary holder. 

The latter is the most irresponsible because according to a credit card specialist I spoke to the next day, I am indeed a secondary owner that did not need to consent to the {$2000.00} credit limit increase, despite it's implications for my financial standing, the fact that we are clearly separated and have been for over seven years, and the fact that the additional XXXX XXXX has already been spent and not at all by me. This agent also advised me that the only recourse was for me to close the account. However, that further jeopardizes my financial well being because I am certain that the other joint owner would simply cease payment and leave me to foot the XXXX XXXX bill that Wells recklessly permitted him to run up after granting him a line increase without my consent. It is clear that I am a "" joint owner '' only for the purposes of their refusal to take me off the account, but I do not have joint agency over it because the "" primary owner '' was allowed to secure and spend an additional XXXX XXXX unilaterally. 

I am asking only to be removed as a joint owner and for the "" primary owner '' who sought a line increase and added me as a joint owner, not as an authorized user as he's claimed to me since 2012,  without informing me to ( justly ) be left financially responsible."

At which time she asked me, "" then how did you know to request the title in XXXX? '' To which I informed her that I had a buyer for the car, but I could not sell it because I did not have my car title! It is not my fault that WF has/had some crazy plan/policy or whatever that when you pay off a car loan they put your car title into their vault! And, that you ( customer/purchaser ) has to request a copy of the car title you just bought! That's insane! It's your car title when you pay off your car loan, NOT WELLS FARGO 'S. They should have sent me my car title instead of waiting for me to request my car title. And then WF did not send me my car title. They sent me information to be used to secure a car title from my local XXXX! I still believe that WF did not if they ever had title to my car. And that's my complaint. I think that by not sending me my car title in a timely manner, WF cost me that sell and several others I could have made had I had my car title. Therefore, I think WF owes me the {$4800.00} I paid them."
3/30/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"SUBJECT : Issue with Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX posting of directs deposits. Customers are lead to believe that they are getting paid up to 2 days early, but in reality the funds are not available for use until the scheduled pay day even though they are added to AVAILABLE BALANCE. Wells Fargo automatically opts-in customers to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX without their consent and customer can not opt-out of the program. Please read below each numbered paragraph for my concerns, questions, and issues with Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX Program ( 1 ) The pending early pay day deposits are deposited into your AVAILABLE BALANCE. According to Wells Fargo online definition : Available Balance is the most current record we have about the funds that are available for withdrawal from your account. It includes all deposits and withdrawals that have been posted to your account, then adjusts for any holds on recent deposits and any pending transactions that are known to the bank. 
( 2 ) In XX/XX/2023, I was enrolled in the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XXXX and XXXX, I experienced difficulties with using Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX. In both months, Wells Fargo posted my pending direct deposits from my payor 's into my checking account as AVAILABLE BALANCE. On XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023, I withdrew funds from my checking account based on AVAILABLE BALANCE. After the withdrawals, my online Wells Fargo statement said my checking account was over drawn. I was told by Wells Fargo Customer Service that they debit the account not from the AVAILABLE BALANCE but from account balance prior to the pending deposits being added to the AVAILABLE BALANCE. 
( 3 ) This is confusing and misleading. I received an email from Wells Fargo Corporate Office ( Case XXXX, XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/2023 stating my pending early day deposits can be used in advance. The email read : Pending direct deposits made available with XXXX XXXX XXXX increases your account Available Balance so you are able to use the funds in advance of your pay day. However, your account ending balance will not be increased by the amount of your direct deposits until it posts to your account on your scheduled pay day. 
( 4 ) XXXX XXXX email is confusing and contradicting. It said I can use my early deposits in advance and also said that my early deposits is not available until it is posted to my ending balance on my scheduled pay day. ( I can provide the email if needed ) ( 5 ) My questions to Wells Fargo are : ( a ) Is this really an early pay day program if funds posted 2 days early can not be used? ( b ) How can the customer use their early pay day deposit if it not part of the ending balance? ( c ) Why early pay day deposits are not included in the ending balance? ( d ) How can I use my early pay day deposits without overdrawing my account? 
( 6 ) As of today, XX/XX/2023, I have received 3 of my 4 XXXX XXXX XXXX deposits for my scheduled pay day on XX/XX/2023. The Authorization Transaction Date for the deposits is XX/XX/2023. My early pay day deposits are XXXX XXXX Retired Military Pension, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and pension from a private firm. The amount of the pending deposits is showing as my AVAILABLE BALANCE. My question is how can I use my funds on XX/XX/XXXX if it not part of the ending balance? ( I can provide screenshots and video of my account if needed ) ( 7 ) In addition to my early pay day issue, I was erroneous charged a {$25.00} checking account service fee in XXXX and XXXX due to my statement ending qualifying balance fell below the minimum. The {$25.00} service fee should not have been charged because I meet Wells Fargo requirement of having a saving account with {$20000.00} or more linked to my XXXX Checking Account. Wells Fargo Customer Service could not explain why I was charged the service fee. 
( 8 ) Throughout my ordeal of trying to get answers and assistance with Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have experienced unsatisfactory, unprofessional and unknowledgeable custom service. Wells Fargo Customer Service Members have been very rude on the phone. The customer service representatives : ( a ) did not allow us to completely explain our situation; ( b ) talked over me when trying to explain my situation and would not let me finish my statement; ( c ) raised their voice during conversation when I questioned their reply ; ( d ) insinuated that I should not afford to keep {$20000.00} in a saving account and suggested changing my checking account type ; ( e ) could not answer questions and would just repeat what was mentioned earlier or remain silence to avoid the question. 
( 9 ) According to Wells Fargo Case XXXX ( XXXX L. ), I can not opt-out of early pay day. I would like for Wells Fargo to either ( a ) stop adding pending deposits to my AVAILABLE BALANCE or ( 2 ) add my early pay day deposits to my ending balance so it can be used in advance like the early pay day program is intended to be used."

And they couldnt help me and only redirected me to the website claims website. And then their website declined/discriminated me.WHICH. IS. ILLEGAL!

It has been a hassle getting my money back from them. They are telling me that they need to research and will issue a refund after 30 days. These guys are not even paying interest while they have my property. Basically, they are stealing from me and hiding behind some bogus rules of theirs. When consumers owe the banks money, they hound on you to get their money back. In my case, the roles are reversed and this bank is hesitant to work with me to return my property back to me quick. This is unbelievable and their communication has been like XXXX!!"
3/30/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"The following are excerpts from a letter we sent to the bank in an effort to document and try to resolve this matter after a prolonged period of abuse culminating in the misappropriation of over {$100000.00} from two closed accounts : Briefly summarizing the five-year history of Wells Fargos XXXX XXXX these accounts : 1. XXXX XXXX moved out of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX California XXXX more than five years ago. 
2. At the time we moved out of that address we notified Wells Fargo Bank of our relocation to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, California XXXX. 
3. Several other businesses with which I am affiliated also relocated at that time and also notified Wells Fargo Bank in the same way. 
4. Although we were assured that the address for XXXX XXXX XXXX would be changed per our instructions it was not. 
5. Over the next five years, XXXX XXXX and I collectively made not less than 50 requests, orally, over, the phone, in person in your branch and other branches and executed any documents required to effect the change, it was never permanently made. It was changed for a very short period and then changed back to the XXXX XXXX address unilaterally by Wells Fargo Bank without instructions from, approval by, or valid notice to our office. When I discovered this improper action, I contacted Wells Fargo and was told that it was changed back per instructions of the Post Office. The bank never produced such instructions. The Post Office never gave such instructions. And I again instructed the bank to follow our directions and change the address to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told the bank would do so, but it did not. On numerous occasions, a number of Wells Fargo employees said they would get the address changed. None of them did it. 
6. In the middle of the Covid epidemic Wells Fargo disclosed for the first time that it could not change the address as it could not find certain information in its files. XXXX XXXX and I provided all the missing information to the bank on multiple ( at least six ) occasions. Each time Wells Fargo told us we had provided all that was required. You were the person to whom the documents were most recently delivered. You have confirmed your receipt and processing of the documents. I also have written confirmation of that fact from XXXX XXXX in the banks small business resolutions department. 
7. On numerous occasions I advised Wells Fargo that we vacated the XXXX XXXX address five years ago and any claim of notice sent to that address would be fraudulent as the bank was absolutely made aware that we did not receive mail at that address on many occasions over the last several years. Notwithstanding these facts the bank continued to mail to the XXXX XXXX address, and we did not receive most of that mail. 
8. I was advised earlier this month that Wells Fargo inappropriately sent notice to the wrong address that if we did not get the information required ( FOR A SIXTH TIME! ) to the branch the bank would close the accounts. We immediately delivered the information to the branch, long before the expiration of 30 days from when we received notice. You advised that you had everything and processed it last week. XXXX confirmed that in writing last week. 
9. On Friday XXXX XXXX talked to you and learned that even though the bank had everything and processed it, the bank unilaterally closed both accounts and intentionally mailed cashiers checks to the wrong address ( XXXX XXXX ). 
10. You were immediately advised by XXXX XXXX to stop payment on the check and reissue for us to pick up. You refused. 
11. On Monday, XX/XX/2023, I talked to you multiple times and demanded that you stop payment on the check intentionally sent to an improper address. You represented that you went to your risk management department and that they instructed you not to do so. 
12. You know from previous conversations and again our discussion yesterday that the continuing and constant mishandling of this account and our documents has convinced us that Wells Fargo or some of its employees has embarked upon a pattern of harassment and abuse directed at me due to the fact that I have vociferously objected to the continued mishandling of our accounts. As I have said, I can not believe that Wells Fargo remains in business if it is that inept at such basic matters and logic dictates that absent such grossly incompetent conduct, the actions, which have wasted many XXXX XXXX XXXX  of my time and XXXX XXXX time must, therefore be intentional. 
13. As Wells Fargo controls the payment of the wrongfully sent cashiers checks, there is no legitimate business reason that it can not refuse to pay the checks and stop payment on them. As Wells Fargo drew the checks without our permission, it would appear appropriate for Wells Fargo to correct its error and stop payment on the check ( s ). 
14. The only risk we see to Wells Fargo comes from potential liability for Wells Fargo if it cashes the checks signed by anyone other than me or XXXX XXXX. Refusing to stop payment on the wrongfully prepared and improperly, mailed checks prior to XXXX XXXX, 2023, as you stated the bank would do creates further risk for the bank in that regard. You have stated the bank will not stop payment before that date and then we must come in and sign papers to stop payment on the check ( s ) we did not approve being prepared with the money for our account, prepared by Wells Fargo without notice to us or our approval, and wrongfully and intentionally mailed by Wells Fargo to the wrong address. We reject that position and believe it is further evidence of harassment and abuse. By the bank and/or its employees. 
15. It appears that Wells Fargo or an employee of Wells Fargo is intentionally doing everything possible to ensure that XXXX XXXX XXXX money does not come to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
16. You are aware that I am XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. We have advised you and others in your organization that we consider the banks treatment of us to be elder abuse in addition to all the other issues we have with it. 
17. Yesterday you described the situation as a travesty. You told XXXX XXXX earlier that you tried everything to stop the closing of the accounts and issuance and mailing of the check but that you could not do so. We understand your conduct as an acknowledgement that the problem was entirely the fault of Wells Fargo Bank and that the account should not have been closed, the checks should not have been prepared, and that the checks should not have been intentionally mailed to a known incorrect address. 
18. In a telephone conversation today with XXXX XXXX, who identified herself as XXXX As manager in XXXX XXXX XXXX department, she acknowledged that her departments investigation concluded that the branch was negligent. She stated that Wells Fargo acknowledged its negligence in the handling of the situation including mishandling of our documents and the preparation and mailing of the checks. We dispute her finding that the Bank was negligent, but accept the conclusion that this travesty was entirely the banks fault. We understand the banks desire to whitewash its conduct as negligent, but we consider the conduct intentional, harassing, abusive and malicious. It is not possible for us to accept that the bank could have done so many things over such a prolonged period out of negligence. The only logical and rational explanation for the long history of misconduct ( only briefly touched upon in this letter ) and has been at all times willful and intentional misconduct by the bank and/or one or more bank employees, for whose actions the bank remains completely responsible pursuant to the doctrine of respondeat superior. 
19. In conversations with you, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, I have demanded the immediate cancellation or stop payment on the check ( s ) wrongfully prepared and allegedly mailed ( intentionally to the wrong address. ) I have also demanded the immediate delivery of the in excess of {$100000.00} misappropriated by the bank. As of this time the bank has failed and refused to honor that demand, notwithstanding its acceptance of fault for the misconduct. 
20. This confirms that I have advised you and XXXX that I intend to contact the federal regulatory authorities and initiate a complaint against Wells Fargo for its customer abuse, elder abuse, harassment, fraud, misappropriation of over {$100000.00} from the two accounts, and the repeated mishandling of its records and the documents we provided to the bank. I have also advised that we are considering the possibility of filing a civil action seeking actual and punitive damages for the banks conduct. I anticipate that in addition to the corporation, XXXX and I personally will be plaintiffs due to the personal abuses we suffered at the hands of Wells Fargo and its employees. While we are perfectly happy to negotiate a settlement of the civil claims against the bank, please note that we will not negotiate to avoid filing of the complaints to the regulatory authorities. 
21. You are now additionally placed on notice that if Wells Fargo negotiates any checks not hand delivered to me or to XXXX XXXX respecting the money misappropriated from the XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts we will hold the bank liable for all losses incurred by the corporation in addition to all other claims against the bank."

I have reached out to XXXX and XXXX for assistance but they did not claim any responsibility. I did not receive the service or protection that was promised or described by them in fact they have a big loophole that enables scam platforms to launder money and steal funds from customers. 

They are complicit in fraudulent practices and did not have any safety precautions in place to protect myself and others from similar scams. My funds sent to them from my account should be investigated and refunded from them. 
I need assistance at this difficult time. My police case is in progress as well.

3/31/23,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"This is a portion of a letter written by order of the Vermont Superior Court during the telephone conference on XX/XX/XXXX. All evidence and documentation held by the Vermont Superior Court. 


In XXXX, one year after I was laid off and unable to find work, we applied for numerous programs through the Making Home Affordable program. We were required to work with the lender ( Wells Fargo ), providing applications and much paperwork and background information. Over the course of many months our paperwork was lost several times ( according to telephone conversations with representatives at Wells Fargo ), requiring new documentation be generated by us ( because according to them it was now out of date being some weeks later and we would have to start over ). It is important that it be known that we had never been late on, or missed a full payment at this time. This went on for some time until they began cashing our payment checks but not applying them to our account. We began receiving letters and phone calls from Wells Fargo demanding payment ( even though we had paid, on time ) and threatening credit reporting and eventual foreclosure ( again, we had never been late on, or missed, a full payment ). After much effort I was able to talk to someone who understood what was going on. She said our payments were placed in a special escrow account for people like us until the application process through the Making Home Affordable program was complete. 

I asked how I could avoid a negative credit rating and was told that they would apply our payments if we stopped applying for aid through Making Home Affordable. I had no choice but to agree to stop the application, and they applied our payments to our account. 

End of Letter We eventually did refinance independently of Wells Fargo but were forced to abandon the house because of work. Our complaint is that Wells Fargo has excluded us from the Court Order requiring them to make amends with consumers whom suffered from their business practices."
3/31/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,I had a {$9000.00} balance transfer check sent to Wells Fargo to pay off my credit card balance for the XX/XX/ due date. Wells Fargo took more than one month to process the check and as a result it was stopped due to being stale dated by the other bank. I also through Wells Fargo 's website had another payment made from one of my checking accounts. Because Wells Fargo attempted to cash the stale dated check they rejected my payment from my checking account stating that my credit card was paid in full and then after realizing that the check was stopped charged my a late fee. I find this unacceptable as they are charging me for their mistakes.

3/31/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I took out two loans with Wells Fargo ( Wachovia at the time ) and used my house as collateral. As time moved on, in or around XXXX, suffered financial hardships like many people here in the country were experiencing and filed for a loan modification with the bank. ( Wells Fargo ). I was verbally told that I qualified but needed to fill out the appropriate paperwork which I did. Meanwhile, the bank began aggressive pursuit of filing for foreclosure of the property. After sending in the documents I was told on multiple occasions that certain pages were missing which I highly disputed. Eventually they acknowledged receiving all of the paperwork and would give me a decision shortly. Meanwhile the foreclosure court date was getting closer. Approximately a month before the court date I received a letter stating I did not qualify for a modification because my GROSS income was XXXX cent, yes, XXXX XXXX which was vehemently false as my tax returns would verify. I filed an appeal to no help and was essentially forced to short sale the property which was heartbreaking to myself and my mother who co-signed on the loan. In XXXX I filed a complaint directly with the bank and they reiterated the same reason. Subsequent to seeing the the lawsuit brought on by your agency for the same issues I reached out to the bank on two occasions this year. ( XXXX ). On the first call and requested review after about 10 days the bank specialist told be they closed by complaint with no further actions to be taken because they couldn't find my account number. I followed up in XXXX of this year and provided an account number which they claimed will be used to do reasearch while opening up a new complaint. I was told they'll have a decision within 10 days but around the 8th day the rep called and said they'll need to XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an express envelope with all of my loan documents as well as a copy of the denial letter from XXXX which stated my GROSS income was XXXX cent. No additional research or review was done. It feels like I am being victimized and defrauded over again and Wells Fargo is refusing to accept accountabilty and properly compensate those whom they willfully and purposely defrauded. I would like to be compensated for the fair market value of the home ( approximately XXXX as well as for punitive damages )"

I need to see which of the transfers Wells Fargo is claiming to be unauthorized. I spoke to the executive and theyre saying they know which ones are because there isnt none. 

Can I have a list of so called unauthorized transfers? Since its not reflecting in my account activity and none of the executives can tell me which ones are."

They closed my dispute without reviewing any of my supporting documents. Then I went to my personal banker and asked her to help me so I had a witness to the documents that were being sent in. And again Wells Fargo Card Claim department said they didn't receive the fax. They closed the case and took the money out of my account again while I was out of State and they left me stranded with no money and without receipt of notification that they again closed the case without reviewing any of my supporting documents. I then started a 3rd case and this time I could email the supporting documents, which I did immediately. I just received notification that "" too much time has passed '' and they won't reconsider my dispute, and I will have to contact the merchant directly. The merchant in this case is XXXX XXXX and they are connected to a cartel in XXXX and Wells Fargo is telling me that I need to contact them myself to get the matter resolved. This is dangerous!!! I was not provided ANY opportunity to have my supporting documents reviewed by Wells Fargo! It is wrong that they promise fraud protection when they don't review the documentation from the customer they promise to protect. They are supposed to protect the customer, not the fraudulent merchant! Customers of Wells Fargo Visa Debit Cards should know that Wells Fargo has poor dispute resolution practices. They will not review your documents and they will ask you to reach out to the merchant yourself, no matter how dangerous that is. This is wrong!"

Also, during one of the calls to Wells Fargo, I had a representative tell me, she didnt know why people in my country have such a problem with these things, when it came to the incorrect name. I explained that the name Wells Fargo erroneously used was that of my exs and it was bad enough that I was told wells Fargo would fix the deed on closing. Now shes telling me I have to live with a document that the notary wont notarize and to add salt to the wound my ex, SAd me. Yes, I love to have the home I worked for associated with my XXXX ex, and have a worker tell me its an issue with people from my country.

We also have essentially the same credit information because we are authorized users in each others credit cards where the other is the primary card holder. 
The only real difference between our applications with Wells Fargo is that I have an obviously male first name while my wife has an obviously female first name.

3/31/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"I am a checking account customer of Wells Fargo Bank Fargo and the victim of a felony-level check fraud that the bank allowed to be perpetrated. The Wells Fargo claims assistance center recently denied my claim for personal restitution. My claim was dismissed after only a casual investigation. Wells Fargo offers customers no process for appealing egregious and minimally investigated decisions like this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I placed in our nearby U.S. Postal mailbox a {$10000.00} check to the Internal Revenue Service for a quarterly federal tax payment, in compliance with specific instructions from the government, as I have done quarterly for the past 10 years. 

This check was stolen en route by someone who overwrote out the payee line "" Payable to : United States Treasury '' and wrote in the name XXXX XXXX. In addition, my Social Security number was crossed off by the forger and the number XXXX written in next to it. 

The photograph of the check front ( I can provide a copy if helpful ) ) shows that the forgery was so crude, it would have taken only a cursory glance to see the check was fraudulent. Still, it was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX, at an unknown location, and honored by Wells Fargo. 

We discovered the fraud on XX/XX/XXXX, while preparing our XXXX tax return, and immediately reported it to Wells Fargo, the Internal Revenue Service, the XXXX XXXX police, the Federal Trade Commission and the US Postal Inspection Service and requested investigations. 

After many interactions with Check Fraud Claims, I was eventually told the unit conducted an investigation that only reviewed the timing of when the fraud was reported -- nothing more. Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, a Wells Fargo official informed me that it will not make me whole and pay back the {$10000.00} the bank paid out to the fraud perpetrator for the reason of untimely reporting. The unit cites the Deposit Account Agreement requiring fraud to be reported in 30 days. I did report it within 30 days -- immediately after I discovered it.

Granted, that was several months after the fraud was perpetrated. But it was an understandable oversight, given the format of your bank statements. Consider how it happened : I had written a check for {$10000.00} to the IRS, and when the account statement became available, I saw that {$10000.00} was withdrawn. I did not click through to look at the image of the check because I knew what it was. 

The Wells Fargo Centers Check Fraud Claim Unit notified me on XX/XX/XXXX, my claim was rejected solely on the late filing date of the claim. I bring this case to your attention for the following reasons : 1. Wells Fargo was negligent in cashing an obviously fraudulent check 2. The Check Fraud Claims Unit, by it own admission, reviewed the claim only on the basis of timely reporting with no investigation or consideration of the broader evidence and extreme circumstances pertaining to the fraudulent act 3. The Check Fraud Claims unit, by its own admission, made no effort to identify the perpetrator or provide information requested by the Internal Revenue Service, the US Postal Service, and XXXX XXXX Police with whom we filed requests for investigations. 
4. The size of the check fraud - {$10000.00} and the fact this check made out to the United /states Treasury was stolen in the process of making my estimated tax payment to the Internal Revenue Service following specific IRS procedures did not factor into the rejection decision.

5. I reported the forgery to Wells Fargo immediately after it was detected. The fraud was difficult to detect when the transaction showed up on the bank statement. The forged check appeared on the page of check transactions showed on the amount of the check which gave the impression of being routinely processed and cashed by the Internal Revenue Service 6. Wells Fargo offers claimants no process for appealing its decisions."

Following it being missing 3 unauthorized ATM withdrawls happened and at 3 different ATMS all over the XXXX XXXX. ( Areas I have never been to or make purchases ) I did not have my card at this point nor knew it was even stolen until the following Monday morning. The Bank even reported it as being unusual or suspicious activity but has denied the claim all together and is refusing to credit the funds. According to Wells Fargo there are no indicators of it being fraudulent, even though I submitted a claim, reported it and they did little to no investigation. I spoke to several claim supervisors that said there was nothing that can be done and they will be denying the claim from here on out. I am prepared to hire a private investigator to look further into this matter. I have locations of the three ATMS and not sure if there is any video evidence they can obtain. But Wells Fargo is not taking this investigation seriously and has not provided any help, action, or reimbursement of my funds being unauthorized dispursed from an ATM without my knowledge.

I informed the agent on the phone that I had adequate documentation that I was never allowed to send in as well as correspondence between myself and the original merchant to prove my claim was valid. I was told once we deny a claim its a loss I have compiled all evidence of my disputed transaction and would like my money back. As well as a THOROUGH investigation to take place. Not once was I given the option to submit documents nor was I asked any questions about where or who to call. Im confused as to how this investigation was carried out.

Our history with WellsFargo has been stellar, keeping high balances and never missing a mortgage payment.

We were transparent with our bank with our financial situation as I was/am the primary provider.

The hold should be released XX/XX/XXXX. 

My concern is that they are not transparent nor can they refer to any regulation or even policy that would apply to this action.

Mortgage rates were substantially lower and I never missed a payment despite several adverse circumstances during this time period.

However after waiting & waiting for a modification they ALWAYS came back requesting more information. I went through the process at least 5 times. I have everything documented. 

They claimed that the modification application expired 90 days after the original date of application and I would need to start over from the beginning each time. New bank statements, new tax forms, new everything. 

I wrote a letter to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Consumer Inquiry and Resource Sponsor, XXXX XXXX to report this ordeal XX/XX/XXXX but did not get any response or assistance.

4/2/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"After the first complaint I filed, was told to bad Wells Fargos records of our account show that no XXXX  XXXX payments were made. 
I have been able to prove they had been made. Not denying it just sorry but its not enough. Ok, Im dealing with and talking about a company that has been sued and fined 20+ times. Now the Cfpb sends all complaints about Wells Fargo to Wells Fargo! Ive been able to prove the XXXX  XXXX payments, sorry but again there records prove different, Oh they say they only go back 7 years. So Wells Fargo can only go back 7 years and XXXX XXXX only to XXXX. This all changed when XXXX XXXX saw the bubble burst coming and began insulating themselves from any lawsuits in the future, by claiming they were never aware and if they were they were not willing and knowingly involved with Wells Fargo and EZ payments through XXXX XXXX. 
I have said since I filed the original complaint. I know we made the payments and we were not behind. I have said since the beginning, I took my receipts from XXXX XXXX, and I was told that I would have a number wrong or switched. I have those actual wires and on them you can see, the 4 that wasnt wrong, thats what I was being told repeatedly! It started in XXXX when we first bought the house. Its still continuing to this day. 
I didnt send all the papers for Wells Fargo to inform me that we had been late or not making payments. When Im fact we were and had made our payments. The blatant strealing started basically as soon as we signed the contract with Wells Fargo. As you can see we made payments from our bank account that shows up months after the actual date of payments. We were making our regular house payment and literally bring bombarded with final notification, the mortgage statement sending payments to XXXX MD, rhe final notice from North Carolina,! the amount of bills and statements. The XXXX XXXX receipts that started in XXXX showing proof of payments to be told I was off a number. I filed complaints with Wells Fargo as early as XXXX, not knowing that XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were just blatantly stealing everything. In XXXX XXXX. I. One month of payments between XXXX XXXX and bank payments! 
We payed and payed. I have never changed what I have said regarding Wells Fargo and their out right criminal actions and activities for so long. Now with the help of the Cfpb, Wells Fargo, XXXX  XXXX, still are robbing consumers. I have proven time and time that all my statements have been true. 
We are asking for XXXX XXXX dollars now since its the 3rd time filing a complaint to be told that oh well you dont have any proof. This proves no matter how or when or what payment process we made, Wells Fargo has continued to refuse to compensate us for now the 22 + years, never denying what Im claiming, because what I have claimed has been true. 
So knowing this and knowing we were and had always been making our house payments, on top of the years and years of double triple billing claiming we never made the payments. 
So we would have never should have been to a loan modification let alone one that raised the principal and extended the payments for another 30 years. The forced bankruptcy, add the health damage to my wife. Knowing she made everyone of the payments only to be told we were past due. In one month XXXX. In XXXX. The mortgage statements are not even right, XXXX shows we never had a loan modification. 
I want XXXX XXXX for the fact I have proven with our first 3 complaints. 
Wells Fargo is still allowed to run a criminal enterprise along with XXXX XXXX and the Cfpb. This is why no consumer can get any type of restitution from years and thousands and thousands of dollars stolen. Stolen by our mortgage company and the payment services they insisted we use due to the easiness they together made for us. 
Now Im retired with limited funds my wife is now XXXX, mainly due to the stress of dealing with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX, which in turn caused a XXXX XXXX to take over again due to and still the stress of all this. When I should just get a call as to were to wire our money. 
Wells Fargo claims they can only go back 7 years XXXX XXXX can only go to XXXX. 
Good thing I have XXXX of just illegal and blatant stealing of every payment made, XXXX  XXXX XXXX our bank account, it didnt matter Wells Fargo took them all."
4/2/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"See Attached letter to XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo detailing the background of my case. Of note my loan modification was approved by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX after successfully completing my trial period. Problems started when trying to process the loan documents. XXXX XXXX, who lives in XXXX, is my common law wife as we have never been legally married. 

At one point I was advised by a Wells Fargo representative that final documents would need to be sent to me in XXXX, MO. and then forward to XXXX XXXX to process and return to Wells Fargo. Later Wells Fargo informed this process was not correct and that documents needed to be sent to me for processing and returning and a separate set of documents would be sent to XXXX XXXX to process. Later I was informed my documents were correct but there were some issues with the documents from XXXX XXXX. Find this strange as her documents were notarized by a Wells Fargo Bank Manager. 

Unable to get help and the correct direction on how to process the loan documents I started reaching out to executives at Wells Fargo.See attached letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX after a call. He informed me I was removed from the review process on XX/XX/XXXX because I did not make follow up contact with Wells Fargo. Of note he also confirmed a Wells Fargo Manager did NOT return my call for help. After receiving different directions from Wells Fargo representatives I requested that a Manager call me and provide the correct way to process these documents. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I elevated my request for help and clarification to XXXX XXXX in the Executive Office. See attached message. XXXX XXXX did not reply to my message. So I tried to reach XXXX XXXX, see attached file and he did not reply. So I finally addressed a letter to XXXX XXXX, CEO asking for help. Shortly after these message a very nice and capable lady XXXX  called me to discuss my case. It was extremely comforting to finally speak with a real live person to discuss my case. 

XXXX XXXX sent me the attached letter on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately some of the research and information provided to her was not accurate or complete. See attached letter I prepared but did not send because XXXX XXXX and I had a conference call with her. 

Please note the phone number in this file is for XXXX XXXX who has an excellent understanding of everything. You have my approval to speak with her or can call me at XXXX."
4/2/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Traveler's check or cashier's check,Lost or stolen check,None,"XXXX XXXX Banking XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo On XX/XX/2023 at approximately XXXX : XXXX XXXX I entered Wells Fargo at located at : Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX FL XXXX Which is approximately 2.5 miles from my part-time XXXX residence located at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX The purpose of the visit was to obtain a cashier 's check as I had won an online auction for a property located in XXXX, XXXX. The auctionnaire required me to have a XXXX percent deposit placed by close of business. 

I previously tried to perform a wire transfer, and although Loss Prevention called me to verify the transaction, I was unsuccessful in conductining the wire transfer on line. 

Wells Fargo requires you to schedule appointments and the earliest appointment they had available is at another location for XXXX XX/XX/2023 which would have caused me to miss the deadline to deposit the funds. 

After speaking to the Auctionnaire, I asked if I could show proof that the cashier 's check would be overnighted to their office before XXXX XXXX  EST for a scheduled delivery for today at XXXX XXXX  if it would be acceptable. XXXX XXXX and Company the auctionaire agreed. 


Since I worked remotely and had recently started a new job I had to move swiftly, to complete the transaction so that I could be back online at work. 

I went to the Bank XXXX whose name is XXXX. I asked if she could confirm how much money I had in my account. I added an additional {$170.00} so that I could have the money that I needed for the cashier 's check. 

XXXX instructed me to insert my bank ATM card which I did. She printed out a receipt showing me my account balance. I asked her to with draw {$5800.00} which was most of the money in the account and to make it payable to XXXX XXXX 

I showed XXXX my cell phone because I had a picture of the address. She fuddled with her computer and then stated that she could not print out the form or complete the form on line for some reason. 

So she handed me a paper and told me I had to complete the high lighted areas which I did. 

While I was completing the form I asked her in the re : line or memo line if she could put XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MD. 

XXXX handed me a couple of posted notes and asked me to write out exactly what I wanted in addition to what I had already completed on the paper. 

She started asking me a series of questions : Q.What was my line of work? 
XXXX  : XXXX XXXX. What was the Casherir 's check for? 
XXXX I won an online auction to purchase a home in the community that my grandmother lived. 
XXXX  Where was the home? 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX. What will I do with the house? 
XXXX XXXX it down and air b and b it XXXX. Did I have a picture of the house XXXX I showed her the picture which included portions of the auction. 

Because I was under time constraints, I was a bit irriated with all of the small talk but I remained professional. 

Then XXXX said that my handritting did not match what was on my drivers license or the signature card. She proceeded to show me the signature card which looked more like my printed name. XXXX informed me that she had gotten in trouble for this and she asked me to write it in a printed way as oppposed to how it appeared on my drivers license in cursive. 

I remember rolling my eyes in my head but I told her that I understand because of fraud she had to be careful. 

XXXX proceeded to show me the screen to verify that the information on the casher 's check was correct. I told her my last name was spelled wrong. She erased the screen and redrafted it. When she presented it the second time my last name was still wrong but I told her it was ok because my last name was spelled correctly except for the memo line which I believed had very little bearings. 

Finally, XXXX correct the screen and I told her it was perfect. 

She then asked me if I had the post it note she had given to me. I said let me check and it was in my purse so I handed it back to me. 

She went on to tell me that she was from XXXX Maryland and I told her that was considered the XXXX XXXX. She said she use to take trips by herself and go differerent places. She recalled going to XXXX and I told her that area was indeed beautiful with lots of boats etc. 

I explained that my family was from the XXXX XXXX over the XXXX XXXX and I asked her if she ever visited XXXX XXXX. She said no. 

Finally, she printed out the casher 's check and showed me the envelope with the cashier 's check and receipt. She made a motion like she was handing it to me, but when I went to recieve it, she pulled the enveope back and asked me if I had a smaller post it note that she had given to me. 

I looked in my purse and saw a small post it note and gave it to her. She handed me the envelope that was sealed at this point and I left the bank. 

She apologized for the delay. 

I immediately went to XXXX because I remembered that they had a XXXX. I waited in line and asked the cashier what was the procedure for sending fedex. 
I was told they dont supply packing materials they are only a pick up location. 

I went to the pharmacy and checked on my prescription and picked up candy because my nerves were shot. 

I found a UPS store about a half a mile away. 

The line was wrong. I finally pulled out the envelope and opened it. To my horror the cashier 's check was missing. Only the receipt was in the envelope. 

I raced back to my car and looked everywhere but I remembered that the enveope was sealed and I only opened it in the UPS line. 

I went back to Wells Fargo and a white man came from behind the desk. I asked if there was a branch manager and he said they did not have a manager at that branch. 

I went to XXXX and I told her she never gave me the check. I told her that I demanded to see a manager and I wanted her to call the police. I told her her actions were deliberate and she knew exactly what she was doing. 

Moreover, I told her exactly how she did it. I told her that she showed me the enveope containing both the cashier 's check and the receipt. I told her that when she asked me for the last post it note, she did that as a disctration and purposely removed the cashier 's check from the enveope. I further told her that I was not going to leave the bank until a branch manager arrived with law enforement and rolled the tapes on our transaction together. 


After I mentioned law enforcement, XXXX said perhaps you misplaced it. I said "" do not patronize me ''. You know what you did. 

Then she said that she could stop payment on the cashier 's check. I told her I had an agressive deadline and her actions were unacceptable. 

She said let me look iat my work. She looked on the side of her desk and found the check. 

I said "" I guess you did find it ''. She apologized. I told her that I accepted her apology but I was reporting this. 

I left. Went back to UPS and called the police when I finished. I was told since I left the bank it was a civil matter. 

I called Wells Fargo and reported the incident to the customer advocate for Businesses. 

I told them that I strongly suggested that the tape be ran of our transaction. 

I also fined a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX."

4/2/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"As a Wells Fargo customer for over 14 YEARS, I am very disappointed at their handling and treatment of customers like myself. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into my local Wells Fargo branch to deposit a personal injury settlement check. I left the check attached to the original paper and even brought the settlement offer letter from the car insurance company in case Wells Fargo needed any other information since the check was over {$10000.00}. When I handed the teller the check, she kept flipping it over and over, checking if the check was fake. The teller then asked me a bunch of personal questions in a rude tone like : - "" Where did you get this check from? '' - "" Why do you have a check for this amount? '' - "" This is a lot for a car accident if you ask me '' - "" What happened in your car accident that they would give you this much? '' It was a very irrelevant and uncomfortable line of questions - it felt like an interrogation. She then told me that she wanted to have her manager look at the check. As a XXXX woman, it infuriated me that I had to go through this line of questioning just to deposit a check. I waited for several minutes while she found a manager who told her the check was legit and okay to deposit. It was such an embarrassing and belittling experience. After calling Wells Fargo call center on XX/XX/XXXX, a complaint with case # XXXX about the discrimination I experienced, but nothing came of it. I am not having consults with business discrimination attorneys in regards to what happened. 

After that situation happened, my wallet and phone were stolen and my accounts were hacked around XX/XX/XXXX. After noticing a lot of irregular transactions, I called Wells Fargo. I offered a police report number and an identity theft report number but Wells Fargo said that was not needed. A claim was filed for the irregular transactions and I was given a provisional credit on XX/XX/XXXX. After several weeks went by, Wells Fargo called me on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, a sick relative had just passed away moments before Wells Fargo called and I was bedside with that relative and was unavailable to answer Wells Fargo call. Wells Fargo left a message that they needed more information on my claim and to give them a call back. The next morning, I called Wells Fargo back at the number provided in the message. I called 3 times throughout the day with no answer from the claims rep. I then logged on to my Wells Fargo account and seen that the credits were reversed and my account was now - {$1100.00}. Even though I returned Wells Fargo call before 24 hours and even though I called several times, the claims rep never answered nor returned my call. Without speaking to me and further discussing the claim, the credits were reversed and put my account in an extreme negative. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my federal and state taxes were deposited to my account. Wells Fargo took those funds. My account is still negative {$600.00}. After reversing credits of {$1100.00} and taking my XXXX tax refund of {$580.00}, Wells Fargo has left me and my family in the worst financial deficit. We are being evicted from our home and other bills can not be paid. As a Wells Fargo customer of 14 years, I never thought that I would be treated in the way I have in the last 6 months. In addition to dealing with my identity and personal information and money being stolen, I had to dealt with the emotional stress of Wells Fargo discrimination and the financial deficit of my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a Wells Fargo rep named XXXX ( phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX ) from Wells Fargo corporate executive office called me to check on my previous case/complaint that had been filed about discrimination. I told her nothing had been done and I was now having consults with discrimination attorneys. I also expressed to her how my provisional credits were reversed and the effect that had on me financially. I told her how I offered my police reports and identity theft reports. XXXX said she was going to work with the correct team to get my credits added back to my account. I have heard nothing."
4/2/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Incident : On XX/XX/2023, while working at XXXX, I was approached by an individual in need of assistance. He requested a ride home and asked to use my phone to order an XXXX, offering to repay me via XXXX. I allowed him to use my phone, and he added his information to order the ride. However, unbeknownst to me, he initiated multiple transactions totaling {$3200.00} without my authorization or consent. I did not click on the prompt that asks if it's a scam, nor did I add his information. Additionally, he changed the receipt name from XXXX XXXX ' to 'XXXX XXXX ' ( Images are attached for reference ). 

The individual transferred the money to XXXX, who has an account at XXXX XXXX. ( This information was obtained from the bank the following day. ) Upon realizing something was amiss after the individual left, claiming he had forgotten his charger, I checked my bank account and noticed that only {$20.00} remained. I immediately contacted the bank to cancel the transactions, but was informed that they were pending and could not be stopped. I spent over 45 minutes on the phone with the bank, attempting to rectify the situation.

Despite being on the phone with the bank for over 45 minutes, I was unable to resolve the issue, and I was left with a significant financial loss due to this fraudulent activity. 


The case numbers are the following : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Actions : XX/XX/2023 : On this day, despite my hectic schedule of working two jobs for a total of XXXX hours a week and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I made a trip to the bank to report the fraudulent transactions on my account. The bank created another case number and assisted me in translating the report from XXXX to XXXX. Additionally, I made a police report, and the police came to XXXX to check the cameras and collect my report. I was instructed by the bank to fax the report to them at XXXX. The report was made to the XXXX of XXXX Police with the number XXXX. 

XX/XX/2023 : Due to my busy schedule, I was only able to make it to the police station on this day to obtain the police report and fax it to the bank. I work long XXXX shifts as a XXXX XXXX  and also have studies to balance, which made it difficult to find time. 

XX/XX/2023 : I made a call to the bank with a friend who could assist in translating my concerns accurately. The bank representative informed us that they had determined there was no fraud in the case as the transaction had been done from an authorized device. However, we asked to speak with the fraud team for more information. The fraud team member was unprofessional and rude throughout the conversation, repeatedly stating that the transaction was authorized and that it was my fault for lending my phone to the bad actor. My friend informed the representative that his tone was unacceptable, and we requested to speak to a supervisor. After waiting on hold for several minutes, we were informed that the supervisor was on the line but then they hung up on us. We made another call to the fraud team and spoke with a different representative. This individual expressed sincere apologies for the misinformation provided by a previous agent, who had incorrectly informed us that the case had been closed and that we were powerless to take any further action. The new representative confirmed that an investigation could indeed be opened, and even suggested that we could expedite the process by submitting a police report via fax at a nearby bank branch. 

XX/XX/2023 : Despite being instructed by the fraud team to fax the police report to the bank, when I went to the bank for assistance, they informed me that they don't fax anything and couldn't help me. After spending an hour in the bank attempting to obtain more information, I was provided only with case numbers that I already had. I have yet to receive a refund or any further communication from the bank regarding my case. 

In conclusion, despite taking immediate action upon discovering the fraudulent transactions on my account, I have faced multiple roadblocks in attempting to resolve the issue. The lost funds were intended for my education, specifically a XXXX XXXX XXXX that requires me to travel to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Without the funds, I am uncertain if I will be able to make the trip, and I have had to borrow money to keep up with my rent and expenses. I am exhausted from juggling two jobs, my studies, and attempting to resolve this issue with the bank, and I am in dire need of assistance."

XXXX was using an expired trust to convince Wells Fargo mortgage department that she was eligible to act as trustee for her daughter 's estate, the Estate of XXXX XXXX which was the legal owner of record of the property at the time. She was granted a personal loan by claiming it was her primary residence which it was not. In fact, all correspondence to her went to her personal primary residence on XXXX XXXX and not our home. We are subject to the foreclosure. This is negligence and fraud on the part of Wells Fargo as conspirator in granting this loan."
4/3/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"This is a follow up complaint to point out and complain of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the agent who lied repeatedly to me and bullied and treated me like a criminal ( instead of admitting he and Wells Fargo were admitted criminals ) and failed spectacularly at fairly compensating me as an obvious victim. Here are my complaints : 1. XXXX refused and Wells Fargo refused to provide me for years with a copy of my mortgage file, XXXX promised me in our second conversation to send me my file which I have recorded and will attach. ( This file was witheld for years bc it has proof of the repetitive violations by WF as a matter of policy. ) I DEMAND AN UNREDACTED COPY OF MY FILE. 
2. The CONTEMPORANEOUS COMPLAINT I MADE WITH CFPB WHICH IS HEREIN IN 2015 BEFORE FORECLOSURE COMPLAINING OF AND PRESENTING PROOF OF THE BAD ACTS XXXX NOW SAYS DID NOT OCCUR PROVE WF "" EVALUATIONS '' to assist their own victims is a complete and utter SHAM. 
3. XXXX XXXX REFUSED TO ACCEPT RECORDINGS OR EMAILS I HAVE FROM 2015 which he is clearly covering up now, as proof of the bad acts WF committed. 
4 DUAL TRACKING WAS IN PLACE AS PROVEN BY MY EMAILS AND LETTERS APPLYING FOR MODIFICATION AND ASSISTANCE PRIOR TO SALE OF HOME. XXXX has DOZENS OF RECORDED CALLS THAT ESTABLISH EVERY BSC ACT. These violations were all exposed in my 2015 complaints to this body and available herein. 
5. The abusive use of many different "" home preservation '' agents where no one agent ever assisted. Instead there was a never ending change of agent every contact none of whom ever had any authority or gave same information, i emailed many of the executives at the time and I have those emails. XXXX was not interested in truth or assidting me as a victim of his employers crimes as CEO XXXX promised Congress. He treated me as the criminal WF admittedly is. 

I want a full investigation of how WF and its cohort company XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are destroying and burying valid claims and conducting sham "" research '' where no victim is givenfirst a voice, where personsal files are stolen from victims, where NO evidence is accepted, where complaints made before foreclosure are ignored, where the admitted criminals who violated the victims are put in position to violate victims again and deny rightful, provable victims a VOICE AND COMPENSATION, I want my MORTGAGE FILE. I WANT COPIES OF ALL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ME AND ANY AGENT OF WF WHETHER EMAIL, text, LETTER OR CALL. 

I WANT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE SHAM, FRAUDULENT "" investigations '' WF AND XXXX XXXX IN PARTICULAR ARE CONDUCTING THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND FAIR WHEN NO EVIDENCE FROM ME WAS ACCEPTED OR CONSIDERED, NO PROOF OR DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED TO SHOW ANYTHING WAS DONE EXCEPT TO MARSHAL ANY "" ISSUE '' REAL OR IMAGINED TO SUPPORT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION THAT WF AND XXXX HAD PREDETERMINED. 

I DEMAND MY FILE AND ALL RELATED LETTERS, RECORDINGS, CORRESPONDENCE, ALL "" FACTS '' upon which XXXX rests this false conclusion. 

It is a FURTHER CRIME FOR WHICH I HEREIN COMPLAIN FOR WF AND XXXX XXXX AND XXXX TO CONDUCT A SHAM SELF SERVING INVESTIGATION AND IS A GROSS VIOLATION OF CONGRESS INTENT TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS. 

IF THIS IS A LEGITIMATE INVESTIGATION PRODUCE MY FILE AND ALL RELATED DOCUMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS. 

THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION ONLY A MARSHALING OF WHATEVER FABRICATED FACTS WF INVENTED TO FURTHER VIOLATE THEIR VICTIMS IN PURSUIT OF ADMITTED CRIMINAL CONDUCT.

It is my charge that WF IS ENGAGING ONCE AGAIN IN SECRET CRIMINAL ABUSES BY CONDUCTING FAKE RESEARCH WHERE NO FILES ARE GIVEN TO VICTIMS, NO PROOF IS ACCEPTED FRIM VICTIMS, AND NO PROOF IS OFFERED BY WF IN SUPPORT OF ITS SELF SERVING DENIAL OF RESTITUTION TO VICTIMS. 

I further DEMAND the CFPB who are given the duty of enforcing restitution orders to MAKE ALL WF DECISIONS PUBLIC AND ALLOW SCRUTINY AND REMOVE THE CLOAK OF SECRECY AND SELF-SERVING AUTHORITY THE ADMITTED CRIMINALS WF AND XXXX XXXX ARE USING TO SUBVERT THE INTENT OF CONGRESS AND THE CFPB."

I called, and went down with a friend to get the sales paperwork one week later, and was told by XXXX XXXX ; Salesman at XXXX that the General manager, XXXX XXXX father died and that he was in XXXX XXXX XXXX 

When I finally got the paperwork, I looked it over and noticed that they put down ' {$2000.00} in assets ', I have no assets at all. The salesman also put in that I make {$4000.00} a month. I work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, we never get that amount of money. I was only making {$13.00} an hour. Also, it was written in that I was at the XXXX XXXX for 3 years, I started with them one month before this sale. 

The Healthcare Agency was bout to fire me as well, so I resigned. There is also something about me putting down $ XXXX, that was to get my car back that I drove there in. I have a Lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX for false representation as well as many other items as they had two eeks to doctor up the sales paperwork. 

Wells Fargo should have checked this sale out before lending the money to XXXX XXXX XXXX, so I'm considering a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Auto Finance as well."

4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,Bank account being deactivated due to fraudulent charges phone 's not being carefully correctly with withdrawals and use of debit card
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I called Wells Fargo ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) to inform them that my purse with all of my cards and identification ( drivers license ) was stolen and that I needed my cards turned off. The representative continued to issue me new cards ( send them in the mail ) and so I thought place a blocker on my account ( but she did not ). The fraudster had already stolen around {$400.00} by the time I realized and turned my cards off immediately. On that following Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), the fraudster went into a physical Wells Fargo branch and transferred everything out of my savings ( $ XXXX ) to my checking account and continued to withdraw {$490.00} without any identification or my debit card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a manager at Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) that someone was there using my card and that she was now walking out of the branch. He continued to tell me that he was holding my drivers license if I wanted to come pick it up. I went to the location to pick up my ID and also call the police to put in another report for this incident. 

After arriving and speaking with the manager, he distinctly remembered her coming in that previous day and today. He said the woman came in stating "" she just needed money '' and that her "" mother and sister just passed away '' I'm assuming to get some sympathy. Two days before this day ( so XX/XX/XXXX ) and on XX/XX/XXXX, he informed me that the woman couldn't answer any of my security questions, the last 4 of my SSN, nor the person 's name attached to my account. This was very alarming because the point of security questions are to protect consumers and that's not what was done here. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had my mother transfer the only {$130.00} left in my Wells Fargo account over to her personal account because it has now been going on for a week. After my mother transferred the money, a few hours later there was a post on my account for $ XXXX. The person had now done a "" deposit item return '' check ( I now know it's some type of scam check ) and knocked my account into overdraft big time. 

I called Wells Fargo back and no answers. My mother and I continued to call them to try to escalate this for days and didn't receive too much help. I continued to let them know that I've been a customer for over ten years holding a checking, savings, and now a mortgage. 

My mortgage is now late without this being resolved and this person has now taken over {$1700.00} from me. 

I did my part by informing them of the theft and turning my cards off immediately. They let the person continue to commit fraud and compromise my information by not closing my account ; now I'm being punished with this not being resolved or even credited because of their employees negligence. 

This has caused a huge strain on my mental health, taken me away from doing my work, and overall access to my money."
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"XXXX - every time I overdrafted my account on accident or had an auto pay bill come out that overdrew my account, Wells Fargo would charge the offending bill first, then other charges from the same 2 day span and charge me three to four overdraft fees in one go. They would only waive {$140.00} in overdraft fees per year, and I was easily getting {$500.00} or higher in overdrafts per year because of what they were doing. 

These days, they just return the transactions. But nothing was ever resolved from the unjust overdraft fees before. Im a low income, XXXX XXXX single parent with a XXXX XXXX  child. I cant afford the overdraft fees and am still reeling from them. Account is now closed but theyve done it to my current account once or twice too."
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"On XX/XX/2021 I got fired from Wells Fargo for having overdraft fees. 
During XXXX I opted out of overdraft fees but they still overdraft me 4 times. 
They ruined my chances of working in finances and it's been over a year of trying to find job security. This has caused me much pain and suffering.

4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"There is a bank name Wells Fargo fraud bank closed my account fraudulently and I lost {$760.00} which every month of the 3rd I receive from the Social Security Administration. I opened this account on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX and they closed my account on XX/XX/, in one month. I gave my this Wells Fargo account number to Social Security Administration to deposit funds in this Wells Fargo account and they said that on this XX/XX/XXXX, they deposited {$760.00} funds in my this Wells Fargo account but before XX/XX/XXXX XXXX came this fraud Wells Fargo closed my account on XX/XX/2023, and sent notice to me and it takes days to receive a notice and then Social Security Administration can't take changed account number fast in some days and deposits funds in a different account. So on this XX/XX/2023, Social Security Administration tried to deposit funds in my Wells Fargo account but I didn't see any funds in my Wells Fargo account because the account was closed. So I lose this XXXX {$760.00} from Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration can't change any personal bank account immediately they take one month to change that person 's bank account. So if I called Social Security Administration to Change my bank account number then they gon na say that they can change my bank account information next or I think on XX/XX/, until they can deposit funds in my Wells Fargo account but this fraud Wells Fargo bank closed my account and I lose my this month {$760.00} and if I wait till XXXX than I gon na lose a total of {$2200.00}. And I requested this fraud Wells Fargo to reopen my account but they didn't reopen the account. 

And they closed my account because I deposit 2 checks in my account from another bank and that other bank returned those checks because there were not sufficient funds in my account and because those funds came into my account at XXXX when I deposits the check but that other bank returned the check on same day XXXX and on same day XXXX  there are so many funds come in my other bank account but because of another bank my those deposits checks were returned and because of that Wells Fargo closed my account. Every bank charges returned check fees from customer 's accounts but this Wells Fargo bank didn't charge returned check fees from my account they closed my account and committed fraud and they did this because, Wells Fargo breaks federal consumer protection laws that apply to financial products, including auto loans, mortgages, and bank accounts. And Wells Fargo is required to pay more than {$2.00} billion to customers who were harmed, plus a {$1.00} billion fine that goes to the victims relief fund."
4/3/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,In 2008 I contacted Wells Fargo that I need help with my loan and possible modification. They said they couldn't help us until we were late on our payments. We called before we ruined our credit and even spent our 401k money to stay current. Once we got behind on our payments they said they couldn't help us because our credit was bad. They did nothing to help us and had a realtor lock us out when we were out to dinner.
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"The people responding to my complaint. Still doesn't get it. Wells fargo weren't exercising their right to close my account until XXXX XXXX lied about me saying I harassed her. My new account wasn't open very long when they closed it. It was closed on XX/XX/2015 after it was open on XX/XX/2015. I was forced to go back and forth to the bank so XXXX XXXX could be at the bank to falsely call the police on me. But the police didn't do anything to me. 

This angered her to whine to XXXX XXXX. He took her side without even talking to me and didn't bother to look at the banks security footage. Which would prove that I wasn't harassing XXXX XXXX. My new account was open only for a few weeks. I had every right to be outraged and angered by XXXX XXXX continue harassment falsely accusing me of harassing her. All wells fargo managers said they had a right to close it. Well their was nothing wrong it wasn't in the negative it was in the positive. XXXX XXXX falsely accused me to them of harassing her and they sided with her against me! Wells fargo let XXXX XXXX get away with harassing me and falsely accusing me."

I submitted 3 different claims regarding this fraud and received the same answer that my bank believes it was authorized by myself or someone who has access to my account. This is not the case, I submitted and provided screenshots and documents proving my accounts were compromised and put hours of work into this matter, missing work to do something my bank should be doing and that's protect my accounts."
4/3/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,"Im demanding for the removal of a missed payment reported by the Wells Fargo Auto loan for XX/XX/2022 Upon further investigation, it has been revealed that the missed payment was allegedly due to inaccurate account information for a scheduled payment. However, this explanation appears to be implausible as payment can not be scheduled without a verified account on file. It is important to note that a payment can not be scheduled without a verified account on file, which leads to the suspicion that my account was deleted by the Wells Fargo system after I scheduled the payment with a verified account."
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"To Whom It May Concern : I write to advise you of unfair and/or deceptive trade practices and improper debt collection processes engaged in by Wells Fargo against consumers. In XXXX, my mother took out two loans on behalf of her business, XXXX XXXX XXXX : one with an account number ending in XXXX and one with an account number ending in XXXX. Like many businesses, XXXX XXXX XXXX fell on hard times over the last few years and was unable to make timely payments. 


My mother began receiving notices regarding the debts earlier this year. I was not sent these notices. More importantly, I had no reason to believe that money in my Wells Fargo deposit account might be at risk as, over the years, I continued to put my own, hard-earned moneymoney earned from my own business enterprises ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and unrelated to XXXX XXXX XXXX  the account. 


Yet, on XXXX XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo clawed {$57000.00} out of my bank account ( account ending in XXXX ), ostensibly because they had a right of setoff that allowed them to take MY money. But while my mother is a co-signer on the account, she put none of the money on that account. The money in the account was mine and earned solely by me. It was not my mothers, not XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite this fact, it has apparently been applied to business accounts with which I have no relationship. 


Curiously, despite my mothers repeated requests, Wells Fargo has not been willing to turn over the loan documents that allegedly permit them to steal from MY account. I continue to doubt that they have such a right and certainly dispute that they could do so without noticing me personally. Nothing required me to maintain my personal deposit account at Wells Fargo. In fact, if I had known that there was any chance that Wells Fargo would take money out of my personal account to satisfy the debt of my mothers business, I would have put my money into an account elsewhere. 


Consumers trust banks with their money and reasonably expect transparency, honesty, and fairness. Wells Fargo has failed to meet any of these expectations in my case. I entrusted Wells Fargo with my money, and they stole it. I ask that the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau act swiftly to right this wrong. 


Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
4/3/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Denied request to lower payments,"I have been contacted by Wells Fargo Auto four times now, and none of the representatives will listen to what I have to say. This was a fraudulent loan. I have a lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX as well due to them reporting assets that I do not have. 

I have told representatives from Wells Fargo Auto what XXXX XXXX XXXX did, and it fell on deaf ears. Once I complete my lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX, I plan on filing a lawsuit against wells Fargo Auto for not looking into my checking accounts in which they should have done before granting this loan, as I banked with them since 2015."
4/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"These people answering my wells fargo complaint. Still refuses to understand anything. Wells fargo didn't use their cause that they can close my account until XXXX XXXX lied about me falsely accusing me of harassing her. They failed to look at the security footage that last day I was in the bank. I was being made to travel back and forth to the bank, because they refused to open me a new checking account over the phone. But this was a set up for XXXX XXXX to falsely accuse me of harassing her. Wells fargo has never statated how I have harassed her because she harassed me and falsely accused me. All these managers keep saying to me is that the bank had a right to close my account. Well they weren't exericing their right until XXXX XXXX lied to them that I was harassing her. But they refused to look at the security footage which would had proved I didn't harass her. The police didn't do nothing to me either, because they saw I was talking to my own banker that day. I never harassed XXXX XXXX, she harassed me. They just need to be shut down as a bank for their continued criminal behavior. 

This is why they had me going back and forth to the bank. So they could do this dirty thing for me and get rid of me. So XXXX XXXX put herself at the bank to falsely lie about harassing her. Wells fargo refuses to do anything or compensate me for their actions of their employee XXXX XXXX. 

The police didn't even back XXXX XXXX that I harassed her that day. But wells fargo wants to back her up and be against me. I am sick of being treated this way."

I obviously told the person on the line that it was not me. They then continued to ask me if I would like to cancel my card, which I said yes. They then read back my information, all my personal information, my account number, card number, last four of my social, my email, etc. So I thought it was legit and that this was the bank because the number they called me on was the Wells Fargo fraud number. They then sent a text through Wells Fargos number and told me to read back the number as it was for my claim. I read the number back and they told me not to look on my account for 24 hours due to the incident. I called my mom and told her what happened and she said it was fraud. I then checked my account and the hacker who was using Wells Fargo then proceeded to take {$2000.00} from my account. I called the bank right away and told them what had happened. They opened a claim and I filed a police report. Around 2 weeks later they denied my claim, saying I approved that transaction by reading the claim number. The people who hacked me, which I talked to the bank about, was a money transfer to the XXXX. The bank cancelled my card and issued me a new account number and card to which the people who fraudulently got me the first time wouldnt get me again but they have still been calling me to this day with my new account information trying to get me a second time. I told Wells Fargo about this and they are choosing to ignore the fact that my information is still being compromised. Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying they were sorry I experienced fraud on my account. So they have acknowledged that this is a fraudulent transaction. Yet they still refuse to refund my money.

I stepped down as XXXX, and began serving as the XXXX XXXX ( XXXX PM ) XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX had 3 accounts with Wells Fargo. I have been overseeing these accounts since XX/XX/XXXX. As far as I can tell, we ( XXXX & XXXX PM ) have began having issues with Wells Fargo, and email accounts in XX/XX/XXXX. My new property management company banks with XXXX. We are paid by XXXX via XXXX payments monthly. 

The first payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. There were 2 handwritten checks : check # XXXX {$2100.00} XXXX payment, and check # XXXX for {$500.00} on-boarding fee as per contract. See exhibit G ( top of page ). 

All subsequent payments to XXXX PM from XXXX Wells Fargo bank accounts were set up XXXX monthly recurring. 

The XX/XX/XXXX XXXX payment was sent XX/XX/XXXX. ( See exhibit XXXX ) Incidentally, on XX/XX/XXXX a paper check was also issued via bill pay ( Exhibit XXXX XXXX lighted ). This check from XXXX Wells Fargo account was issued from XXXX PM ( using my home address ) to XXXX PM ( using my business address ). This check went unnoticed, and was unknowingly deposited back into XXXX Wells Fargo account along with other checks received on XX/XX/XXXX ( See exhibit XXXX ; for deposit details see page # XXXX ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the normal ACH payment was made to XXXX PM ( See exhibit C ). Then on XX/XX/XXXX, an electronic check was sent to XXXX PM ( via bill pay ) again using my home address from XXXX PM using my business address ( See exhibit XXXX ). This check was deposited back into Wellsfargo XX/XX/XXXX via Bank teller ( See exhibit A & page XXXX for details ). This is when these bill pay payments first came to my attention. I went into the branch, and asked a teller who then called a supervisor. We were all puzzled. They said it was just a glitch. 

I went home, and combed through the XXXX WellsFargo account, and noticed the bill pay check on XX/XX/XXXX. I pulled up the check for details, and immediately called the number written on the front of the check. A WellsFargo rep, and I spent quite a bit of time on the phone trying to figure out how this happened. She deleted the bill pay at this time. I submitted a claim for both bill pay checks. 

This same day, I notified XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX about the situation, I explained that I had filed a claim with Wells Fargo for each check. 

At the same time, XXXX was locked out of her email account, and could not get in. As the XXXX, I did everything to assist her, but she was not able to log in from any of her devices. XXXX suspended her account because of an illegal login attempt. There was an IP address with the notice. I traced it to an address in Florida ( see attached ). I, too, begin receiving warnings from XXXX about suspicious sign in attempts. At first, I thought these were two separate incidents, but then concluded this had to be a cyber attack. 

Could this be connected with Wells Fargo, and the XXXX payments scandal? Both of our email accounts were linked to XXXX payments from homeowners. 



XXXX and I contacted the attorney, and sent documentation via email. Next, we both tried to notify the other XXXX XXXX. Unfortunately, they didnt take this threat serious. In fact, the XXXX begin sending a flood of emails with accusations that perhaps, I was the culprit. 

The attorney agreed we should close the Bank Accounts, and shut down the emails to mitigate any damage. However, the XXXX insisted the accounts and emails remain open. Because my name was associated with these accounts, I took the attorneys advice. 

A few days later there was a XXXX meeting which I was excluded. XXXX was not given the opportunity to explain, and I was not allowed to attend. The XXXX removed XXXX XXXX. I resigned, but continue to investigate Wells Fargo. I filed a police report in addition to the claims with Wells Fargo. Im not sure whats going on. I keep getting transferred from one department to the next. 

This past weekend, I was talking to a friend about whats going in. She told me about Wells Fargo XXXX involving XXXX XXXX and XXXX years ago. I watched the videos on XXXX, and believe this may be what happened to these Wells Fargo accounts. 

After I closed all XXXX Wells Fargo accounts, my husband and I received separate postcards in the mail from Wells Fargo stating our address has been updated on our mortgage account. The problem is, we dont have a mortgage with Wells Fargo! I reached out to Wells Fargo, and they said they dont have a record of this mailing it was probably a glitch"
4/3/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"The bottom line for me to file this complaint is because I never missed any monthly payment, From XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX, when Wells Fargo intentionally put me into XXXXorclosure stsing I wasn't making my monthly payments, Which was Not True .... I was always making my payments, but on my monthly statements it showed "" NOT APPLIED "", Payment was made but Wells Fargo was not applying my payments to my loan ..... 
They were intentionally making it look as if I wasn't making any payments at all But I was, and Never did I stop making my monthly payments. 
Their goal was to take my home for financial gain for them, and Left me homeless. 

Most important is that I called Wells Fargo and Spoke to XXXX XXXX in the Executive Offices of Wells Fargo, I offered and ask to let me Airmail a check for the {$9000.00} they stole from me by not taking the money I paid, never applying this money to my loan. 
I ask them where I could Airmail a Cashiers Check to Please apply this to my Mortgage, put my loan back in good status and stop the foreclosure. XXXX XXXX told me they would not accept my check, because my home was much more valuable and they were not going to stop the foreclosure process. 
This is why they dont have the recording of me talking to XXXX XXXX XXXX It was destroyed. 

I know for a fact that Wells Fargo has destroyed anything that would show that they intentionally foreclosed on my home only for their financial gain. So there will not be any documentation that would reflect their unlawful procedures. 
Anything and anyone that was part of this illegal fraudulent process have been removed, let go so they could not verify against what they did and the process they force me through to Steal my home from me and destroy my life. 

Since I was forced out of my house, and living on the streets I was not able to save any documentation that I had and they know this. 
That is why anything they did save will only reflect in their favor, all to hide the truth of them putting me into forclosure. 

MORE INFO... 
I wanted to say a few more things because what Wells Fargo intentionally did That completely destroy my marriage of 25 years, separated my whole family was all only for money, a company that has Billions of dollars, How Greedy must you be to do things like this I swear to you that everything I have said to you is 100 % the truth, am hoping that youll be able to see that during your research, and Im praying that youll be able to help me get back what I have lost. 
Which you know I cant get that time back, but maybe with your help I can reconnect with my wife and kids as a family like it was supposed to be I struggled and pleaded with them to let me pay them the entire amount they claimed I was behind on my mortgage payment, which I was never behind, I was making my monthly payments. 
We even setup automatic payments, the money was drafted, but again Not Applied to my loan. 
They took {$3800.00} all not applied to my loan, and I canceled that. 
They would not except my payment I offered, a Cashiers Check for {$9000.00}, That I would have airmailed to them, and for them to put my loan back in good standings, and leave me alone. .Any other financial company would have accepted this. 
Unbelievable, Knowing how they were going to just rip my life to pieces without a care. 
They damaged everything including my credit I had a credit score of XXXX, After what they did I was set back to a credit score of XXXX. 
Still today, My exwife and XXXX daughter live in a very small apt . just like I do. 
My Ex-wife was my high school sweetheart, we were together for over 30 years The only way or chance I would have to get her back, and my family back the way we were is to be able to buy her a new house, this would also give me the chance to see all my family together again for Parties, the holiday, etc. 
I know that there was {$3.00} XXXX Dollars that they were to use to compensate all the people that they took advantage of and filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
So hopefully you will be able to get me what I deserve.. 
There is no dollar amount that can give me back all that I lost, and all the time I lost being together with my wife and kids I pray to God that you are doing this for me, and see that Wells Fargo did something really wrong, and that you can compensate me for all I have had to go through because of this, It should have never happened. 
I want to thank you for looking into this.. Hopefully Ill hear from you soon. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

4/4/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"XXXX. ) This started when I set up online access for my bank accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an appointment with Wells Fargo ( WF ) branch manager ( XXXX  XXXX XXXX ). She was pleasant and set up my account with phone number, email address, username, and a temporary password. 
XXXX. ) Tried to change the temporary password at home. Got a screen saying to call an 800 number and get a code after giving authentication. 
XXXX. ) Called the number. Was denied a code because I dont have a debit card with WF and also because they dont have a cell phone number on file. Hmmm WF has my email address! WF sends marketing emails to it! 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, had anther appointment with WF branch. Met again with XXXX XXXX XXXX She called WF 800 number and they said they sent the code to our email address. We never received it. No, its not in spam or blocked. They said they sent another email. Nope. They verbally gave the code to Endurance at the branch office. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I accessed my account at home and changed delivery preferences for statements. 
XXXX. ) I then tried to access my account from a different computer at home. Got another screen saying to call the 800 number and ask for a code. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, got an email that said, in part : Youre receiving this notification for one or more of the following reasons : You changed your delivery preferences, we changed your delivery preferences for selected statements and notices to online, your account is no longer linked to online banking, we were unable to deliver your documents or notifications because your primary email address is invalid. I assumed the the email was just confirmation- though its absolutely unclear from the WF email as you can see. Also assumed that email is ok because WF is sending marketing email to it. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX got an email from WF saying theyd temporarily suspended my account due to suspicious activity. Changing delivery preferences is supposed to be a valid activity. Using a different computer is also supposed to be a valid activity. 
XXXX. ) On XXXX, had another appointment with WF branch. When Endurance called, WF had no explanation for why my account was suspended or what the suspicious activity was. Note that WF suspended every account that had my name affiliated with it- including my XXXX mothers checking and savings account ( Im her trustee ) - and that is absolutely unacceptable! Note that it took 2.5 hours at a the branch office on hold waiting for XXXX phone call to go through and for my account to be reinstated. I also changed my username and password at their request. 
XXXX. ) WF was to send an email to us. I think it was to send a code?? At any rate, we still didnt get that email either. On XXXX, I emailed and asked Endurance to file a complaint. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply. The email said, in part : We realize that this may have been an inconvenient situation for you, and we apologize for any frustration you experienced when you attempted to gain clarification regarding this matter. Our research has confirmed that you enrolled in online Banking services on XX/XX/XXXX, and your online Banking status is active. In addition, you updated your online password and username successfully. If you still having troubleshooting please, contact our Online Banking Customer Service line. Their response appears to be a form letter. Nothing was resolved and it appears that no research was done. It just described the account status and restated the obvious. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed Endurance and asked to file another complaint. I also asked for a copy of the complaint she submitted. I emailed twice. No response from Endurance, so dont know what was submitted. 
XXXX. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a reply. The email said, in part : We have determined we previously addressed your concerns and did not find you enclosed any new information that would change our response. We have reviewed your account activity since our prior response and our decision remains the same. We were able to determine the account restriction was prompted due to online changes that were made. We understand your concerns and want to assure you that we have strict guidelines and security policies to protect the privacy of your information. We have researched your concern and determined your personal information was not compromised or mishandled. Again, nothing was resolved and it appears that no research was done. It again just described the account status and restated the obvious. 
========== To summarize, Ive made three trips to a WF branch office and two complaints have been filed with the WF Line of Business Executive Office. No one has addressed the problems. 

I identified two problems ( below ) for the complaint that I asked Endurance, WF branch manager, to file : XXXX. ) WF thought there was some unexplained suspicious activity and suspended my account. When Endurance called, WF had no explanation for why my account was suspended or what the suspicious activity was. Note that WF suspended every account that had my name affiliated with it- including my XXXX mothers checking and savings account ( Im her trustee ) - and that is absolutely unacceptable! 

Since WF has no explanation, whats to prevent this from happening again? It took 2.5 hours at a branch office on hold waiting for Endurances phone call to go through and for my account to be reinstated. The suspicious activity issue needs to be resolved/explained. 

XXXX. ) Any online change I make ( such as using a different computer ) triggers a WF screen that tells me to call an 800 number and get a code after giving authentication. Im then told that Im denied a code because I dont have a debit card with WF and also because they dont have a cell phone number on file. Note that WF has my email address - WF sends marketing emails to it. 

I then have to make an appointment with the WF branch and then the 800 number people verbally give the code to the branch. Since WF has no explanation for why it can not email a code to me, I can only assume it will happen again. WF not sending a code via email needs to be resolved."

During that time, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, had gotten sick in XXXX and I reached out to the company for assistance. As we were making our payments, we were denied a modification and were forced to do a short sale on the property in which we had a realtor involved. The realtor was in the process of submitting all the necessary documents for the short sale and due to negligence from Wells Fargo, they foreclosed on the property prematurely. I believe that we were wrongfully foreclosed on due to their unethical practices. We were trying to get the foreclosure reversed and we were speaking to upper management and all they said to us was that they apologized. Since then, there has not been any reporting of foreclosure on any of the homeowner 's : XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX 's credit report.

In XXXX after the XXXX XXXX  spill me a XXXX  XXXX lost income due to the shut down of the tourism to XXXX. The XXXX XXXX hospitals census went so all their hospitals kept their patients. Non were going to the long term care like kindred. I was told to stay home My income was cut in 1/2. 
I called wells fargo that I wanted to apply for a hamp modification. What ensued caused me and my husband to eventually lose our home. 
Wells fargo employees told us we had to be 90 days late in payments in order to apply for a hamp modification. ( XXXX things are more share with me. XXXX  pays out at XXXX  days after default and the hamp. Modification was only available to government mortgages ( fha ) not conventional ) I cried and told them I am a XXXX  XXXX since XXXX I do not want to go into default. They wag the only way to apply for the hamp. I had put XXXX down on my home and paid off XXXX in car/ motorcycle loan before buying the house. So a total of XXXX was invested. 
Wells fargo was servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells fargo did me for foreclosure XXXX. Dual tracking me all the whole losing my my documents and moving my application files so me to approve me since I couldn't be i hah a conventional mortgage. 
They didn't produce discovery when my lawyer motioned the court. They just kept sending me trial modifications. Pay XXXX trial payments and I would be approved for a permanent but on the internet homeowners were paying these trial payments and never being approved for someone's over 2 years. So I didn't want to be involved in this money grab scenario and they dual tracked. Foreclosed while I was trying to apply. They have the mortgage to nationstar in XXXX with no original documents presented and then XXXX took over in XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was my set trial and no discovery submitted or motioned for my lawyer must have been paid off to walk away from my case ( my previous lawyer who lost his bar card told us that was happening. He was offered XXXX to walk away from a case do we know it's happening ) So the night before the set trial in which I was going to lose since my lawyer didn't have any defense i had to settle. No Money. Only XXXX  months. That's what I get for my XXXX All my equity gone. And cfpb is being praised and not wanting to homeowners like me. Wells Fargo keeps telling lies. They don't have any record of telling me to be late on my mortgage and they have no record of dual tracking me lol. Why would an RN of XXXX  years tell lies about her XXXX investments in her house when wells fargo is being fined for making poor choices? 
I asked to get the money from the settlement and they continue to deny me well I will continue to complain This last complaint the man that wells fargo had call me was a real peace of work. Would not let me talk, didn't care, acted like he owned the company not just an employee He was as rude as they come. WoW so I wouldn't not praise cfpb into something is done to help over 20 million homeowners who lost their homes to the hands of the to big to fail banks. Maybe it's time to question their business practices like making more servicing fees in foreclosure then collecting mortgage payments. 
Or sending trial modifications and foreclosing anyway. 
I think enough is enough homeowners need restitution. What XXXX  did is a crime telling us all to call our banks and ask for a hamp modification when knowing conventional mortgages could not me modified. Very sad. So much homelessness. Time till return homes to the homeowners. 
Oh and what is the purpose of the statute of limitations law. My mortgage was past the statute of limitations for collecting and not even on my credit report anymore yet the XXXX county court in XXXX  still set my trial and took my house in XXXX. Past the XXXX  year statute of limitation that stayed in XXXX. I call for restitution to all homeowners that went through this horror"

XXXX XXXX calls me saying something like, Hi maam, my name is XXXX and I am with the Wells Fargo Fraud Department XXXX My employee identification number is XXXX. We detected fraudulent activity with your account and wanted to review some of the recent charges. Please note that this call is recorded for quality purposes. She proceeded to ask me if I had traveled to XXXX XXXX because there was a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  charge from XX/XX/XXXX outside of my home area. When I said no, she asked me about actual purchases I had made in the last week. She said, Did you spend {$74.00} at XXXX or {$120.00} at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX? Those were accurate amounts of money that I had spent at these places getting groceries the previous weekend, so I believed XXXX was looking up my information in some Wells Fargo computer to help me. I noted that XX/XX/XXXX was Monday, but I figured the transactions didnt get posted until the first business day after the weekend. 
XXXX XXXX I check my bank account on my work laptop to see the charges she was talking about. I didnt see any of them. I assumed they were still being processed by XXXX. 
XXXX I receive an email from XXXX that my card was declined at an ATM at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX told me she was generating a claim number for my case after she flagged the purchases that I did not make. She also said that in the meantime we needed to cancel my current card and mail me a new one. To authorize your new card, XXXX told me she needed to transfer me to someone else for verification. When she did, I heard an automated message telling me to input my PIN to reset my number. I followed the prompts that it asked for and then was transferred back to XXXX. ( Key locking? ) XXXX XXXX  XXXX tells me the limits for the debit card need to be changed for the new card. She tells me that I will receive a text message to my phone number that ends in XXXX in a few seconds. I had to wait for a while.

Card XXXX {$860.00} @ ATM XXXX {$980.00} @ ATM Transactio Reply Y if recognized or call XXXX. I asked XXXX why I was being asked to verify something that I wasnt doing. She said, This is for the card limits, I know its confusing, you just need to send Y ( RE : Charges : {$120.00} withdrawn. {$860.00} removed three times, but re-deposited twice ). I double checked the phone number that I was talking to and noted that it was the one listed in the message I was just texted. Why would I call the same number back when I was already talking to someone? I resigned to getting more details about the card. She said, You have the option to wait for the Postal Service to deliver it in 7-10 business days, or we can Priority ship it with FedEx. Normally, there is a {$12.00} charge but we are going to waive that for you. Please confirm the address for shipping. I told her that would be amazing and I would love to have it FedExd to my place, so I gave her the address associated with my account. She gave me a tracking number and date that it would be available # XXXX when it was shipped around XX/XX/XXXX. We ended the call.

I did and XXXX confirms the check is valid. Wells Fargo then informed me that the maker of the check XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX communicated to Wells Faro that there is a risk associated with the check and it has to be on hold until the XXXX to attempt again. However, they are not required to provide any details. My account at Wells has a "" pledge '' placed on it by their Loss Prevention Department, as a result. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX will not provide me with any information that justifies their actions to refuse to fund this legitimate check. There is no problem with the check. Wells Fargo tells me that you are the regulating agency that I need to go to in order to hold the people who made this erroneous action accountable.

Wells fargo said it in writing it was because I harassed XXXX XXXX, they can never explain how I harassed her because they can't because she harassed me. MY first account was open for 1 year with no issues. XXXX XXXX should be banned from banking for how my private information along with my sons was compromised and it wasn't any misunderstanding!

But I had the original one open the first year without them exercising their right to close my account. Banks have way too much freedom to do people wrong. It was all a setup to get rid of me. XXXX XXXX was not at the bank on XX/XX/2015 but just happen to be at the bank on the last day I was finishing up opening my new account.

4/6/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"During Covid 19, Wells Fargo offered a program to defer payments. We took advantage of the deferral with the agreement that all missed payments would be added as additional months on the end of the contract. Mortgage maturity was XX/XX/XXXX. Numerous conversations verified this arrangement. As we approached the end of XXXX, Wells Fargo demanded a balloon payment of ~ {$13000.00} to satisfy the deferred payments. This resulted in a major financial hardship as it was not in the form of monthly payments ( 5 deferred payments of {$2700.00} ) as described. Numerous phone calls and escalations ensued with no resolution. We were told we would go into default and potential foreclosure. Mortgage has since been paid in full using our savings and XXXX XXXX card. Mortgage was always current and never in arrears. In the end, a certified letter was sent to us expressing the details of payment due and to make the impression of what was Wells Fargo 's position. We did demand record of all communications both written and recorded, but Wells Fargo refused. Recorded phone conversations from Covid to present will verify/substantiate our complaint."

I knew I had a bunch of things coming out of my account and a way to make sure they were not going to come out of my account. 

The banker told me if I changed my card that I would have to reconnect to any bill to have it come out of my account. I needed a new card because of a damaged chip anyways. 

This was not the case the company that pays my rent on the first of the month still came out. It breaks the payment up and charges me the first half on the first and the second half later on in the month both payments are XXXX plus another XXXX XXXX  charge. I was planning on breaking my lease and had already talked to the property manager about it. I also had a XXXXXXXX XXXX charge come out as well.

4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Unable to open an account,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to make an official complaint against Wells Fargo for its discriminatory lending practices against me. I recently applied for a Business Account with Wells Fargo and was denied without explanation. This has caused me to suffer significant financial distress, and I believe my denial was motivated by bias due to my race and ethnicity. 

I am a Latino-American male, who has historically been the subject of discriminatory practices in the banking industry. Part of the reason why I selected Wells Fargo to make this mortgage loan application was that I expected to enjoy a fair and equitable treatment from an institution that has been in the business for so many years. However, I now believe that I was offered different and less favorable terms than what a non-Latino applicant would have been offered. 

I would like to request an investigation into Wells Fargo 's pattern of behavior and treatment related to lending, particularly with Latino American applicants. I personally feel wronged by your organization and expect to receive an apology and clarification as to why I was denied opening a Business Account. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

4/6/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo is my current mortgage holder. Has been since XXXX of XXXX. We had XXXX mortgage escrow analysis during XXXX- which was delivered to us through mail and through our online portal. Sufficient information as required through RESPA Section 10 for escrow analysis. 

With that being said for XXXX, i have been watching our mail and our online portal, everyday for an annual escrow analysis since our appraised value on our home went up through our XXXX XXXX. I have not received anything from XXXX - current date. 

When our mortgage payment was withdrawn on XXXX for {$3200.00}- which is DOUBLE what our mortgage payment was/should have been of {$1800.00}. Once I realized, today at XXXX XXXX that we had not received an escrow analysis to show that we did or do have an escrow shortage, I contacted Wells Fargo immediately to ask why we never received the escrow analysis through the mail or on our online portal. 

Their response, "" Well, we mailed it so it must have gotten lost in the mail. '' Okay, well why isn't it on my online portal in my statement and documents? "" I can email it to you, if you want. '' No, unacceptable. 

They stated that my escrow was short {$10000.00} ; but how would I know where that shortage came from or what is being aggregated to what. 

RESPA Section 10 states that the following needs to be in the contents of an escrow account statement : ( i ) The amount of the borrower 's current monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly payment going into the escrow account ; ( this is on my monthly statement, so I won't say I didn't have this in the "" contents '' ) ( ii ) The amount of the past year 's monthly mortgage payment and the portion of the monthly payment that went into the escrow account ; ( Didn't receive this as it is not on a mortgage statement ) ( iii ) The total amount paid into the escrow account during the past computation year ; ( If I was to get my YE mortgage statement to see the YTD escrow accounts ) ( iv ) The total amount paid out of the escrow account during the same period for taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges ( as separately identified ) ; ( If I was to get my YE mortgage statement to see the YTD escrow accounts ) ( v ) The balance in the escrow account at the end of the period ; ( If I was to get my YE mortgage statement to see the YTD escrow accounts ) ( vi ) An explanation of how any surplus is being handled by the servicer ; ( N/A ) ( vii ) An explanation of how any shortage or deficiency is to be paid by the borrower ; ( Didn't receive this as it is not on a mortgage statement ) and ( viii ) If applicable, the reason ( s ) why the estimated low monthly balance was not reached, as indicated by noting differences between the most recent account history and last year 's projection.

I immediately sent/stated {$7000.00} will be return. I was charged interest on it and fees. Also my payments are auto payments and rather then taking the fund on the agreed date, they wait about to days to get the money out of a Wells Fargo account. When I make additional payment that place it as interest, rather than towards the principal. Their practices are questionable and need to be looked into. If I was a person, that does not monitor this, I would be robbed. They will do right for a moment, than go back and do the same actions and add fees. I send additional payments to go towards the principal, NOT the interest.

The same day XXXX sent an email that they'll respond back to me within 10 business days from that day which was the XXXX if not they would reach out to me and let me know they will need additional time as of today 's date no one has reach out to me as of vet. 

XXXX XXXX I sent XXXX an email stating I just got off the phone with XXXX from scratch he forwarded me additional information with verification from XXXX XXXX on their end as well that they never asked for my funds ( see exhibit D ).

On XXXX XXXX I received a response from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) because I filed a complaint against Wells Fargo. Please see attachment. I finally got a response due to be filing this complaint from XXXX. 

There are a few electronic funds transfer violations with this issue. 

XXXX. Wells Fargo stated that XXXX XXXX requested funds back, but they ( Wells Fargo ) did not till this date send me ANY verification from XXXX XXXX that states otherwise. The XXXX provides pursuant to 15 USC 1693g ( b ) that the burden of proof is upon the financial institution to prove the consumer liability. Wells Fargo has failed to do just that and just stated disgracing statements such as saying the transaction was fraudulent. 

XXXX. Wells Fargo stated that if the claim is not received in 60 days "" we will mail a cashier 's check to your address for the collected available balance in the accounts '' evidenced in exhibit B they have failed to return my funds. The XXXX provides pursuant to 15 USC 1693f ( a ) that a financial institution shall investigate the alleged error, Wells Fargo has failed to do so as I am not in receipt of any verification from XXXX XXXX stating they wanted forgiven funds back. 

XXXX. The XXXX provides pursuant to 15 USC 1693f ( b ) that the financial institution shall promptly correct the error including crediting the interest where applicable, they have failed to do as."

4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,I accidentally deposited a check that was fake but I wasnt aware that it was fake. it was an accident and the bank closed my account and im unable to open another account or even a second chance account
4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Funds not handled or disbursed as instructed,"I believe Wells Fargo violated laws in how it handled my complaints regarding fraud on my checking account. 

I was XXXX  in XXXXXXXX XXXX. After that, I suffered theft from my home, including electronic devices previously used to log in to Wells Fargo online. Someone fraudulently transferred tens of thousands of dollars from my account. I reported the transactions immediately upon discovering the fraud and a police report was made regarding many stolen items. 

In previous Consumer Finance Protection Bureau complaints, I specifically said I was XXXX and therefore could not possibly have had access to my phone or any other device to make transactions and had not authorized anyone to take any action on my accounts. Despite this, the final answer from Wells Fargo was denial of my claim, explaining that because they believe the transfers apparently happened while someone was logged into the bank portal on my device ( even though it was stolen ) they decided it was me or someone authorized by me to make the transfers. 

I believe Wells Fargo has violated laws in two ways.

First, if someone steals a device authorized to access a bank account, then transfers large amounts of money out fraudulently, but the bank fails to contact the consumer to verify the sudden, unusual transaction activity, the bank may have violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and/or state law.

Under the EFTA, banks are required to have pr
ocedures  in place to protect against unauthorized transactions. These procedures include requiring customers to provide identification before making large or an unusually large number of transactions, or contacting customers to verify large transactions. If a bank fails to have these procedures in place, and as a result, a customer loses money due to unauthorized transactions, the bank may be held liable for the customer 's losses. Wells Fargo allowed tens of thousands of dollars to flow out of a relatively new personal bank account with no prior history of making so many large transfers without ever contacting me or asking me to come to a branch to prove it was me making these transactions, which I could not have done at the time since I was XXXX If they had, I wouldn't be in this situation now. 

Second, regarding Regulation E, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau explains, among other things, that "" Unauthorized EFTs include transfers initiated by a person who obtained a consumers access device through fraud or robbery and consumer transfers at an ATM that were induced by force. '' I have explained and sent proof of my incarceration dates, during which I had no access to any devices and was not contacted by Wells Fargo at any point to verify that it was me making these large transactions, and I have provided a police report regarding my phone being stolen. Still, Wells Fargo decided these transactions were authorized. This is impossible, contrary to the claim and evidence, and I believe their subsequent denial of my claim is in direct violation of the EFTA and one or more parts of Regulation E."
4/6/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I have an ongoing dispute with Wells Fargo for fraud. In XX/XX/XXXX my card ending in XXXX was used to make fraudulent purchases at XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo continues to state the charges are valid and they are not. Yes I have had fraud on my Wells Fargo credit card in the past. The only fraud that was investigated thoroughly was made at XXXX and XXXX in XXXX. The police did a thorough investigation of this charge which is attached. It indicates surveillance from the store showed a XXXXXXXX XXXX using my card at the register. Then again in XX/XX/XXXX I had 2 fraud charges to XXXX  by XXXX XXXX for XXXX and XXXX. I have alerts set up on my account for any charge greater than {$100.00} and received an alter for these transactions. I contacted Wells Fargo and I believe they declined the charges but am not certain. 

Wells Fargo is in essence attempting to accuse me of making charges and reporting them as fraud and filing false police reports which is against the law. They harass me when I call and say things like 'you have too many fraud charges '. 

All I can say to that is yes I have had fraud on my Wells Fargo account. I've asked them to send me video survellaince from XXXX and XXXX XXXX  to prove that it was me that made the charges. They claim they can not do that. Most police departments don't seem to take fraud seriously. I was fortunate that the XXXX XXXX  did a thorough investigation of the XXXX XXXX  XXXX fraud charges. 

Wells Fargo is harassing me claiming I made the XXXX and XXXX XXXX charges. I nor anyone in my household or anyone known to me made these charges.I. can't even drive so I could not have made the charges and even went to the extent of providing HIPPA protected medical records to show the vision issues Please get them to stop."

I had first try to do it online but then the process was rejected and so I called and they told me I had done it wrong. On XX/XX/XXXX. I had an employee complete the transaction for me so that it was done correctly. Then for me that I should have no problems, and that everything was done correctly. a couple days later on XX/XX/XXXX my card was closed with no explanation. They claim they sent out mail but there is no way they could have sent mail and I had received it within just a couple of days. They said it was because of those two attempts to move the funds It was considered fraud. Again, I was not aware a bank was able to just close that account without calling or making sure if it was fraud. I explained that to them and no one ever got back to me. I kept calling and calling and calling and no one ever had any answers. Since then I have gone through financial struggle and my credit completely plummeted. I want to take legal action, but I was in the middle of having my first child, and I had too much to deal with to keep calling and haggling with them when they knew it was their fault. Below is a list of all the conversations and times that they should have even on their record. They record phone calls, so they have this on there and also. I have been a customer since XXXX and it is extremely heartbreaking All my hard work has gone to waste. 

Called to complete transaction : - XX/XX/XXXX Card Closed - XX/XX/XXXX ( Mailed of info about card ) Case Opened - XX/XX/XXXX Case Closed by bank - Case # : XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Case was closed because the issues was resolved - Only point of contact or follow up was through mail Follow Up Call - XX/XX/XXXX - new case # created : XXXX - Intake group department # to follow up XXXX - Hours : M-F XXXX central time - Will be contacted within 10 days, stated by employee"

I verified that I DID NOT AUTHORIZE any transactions. A report was immediately filed. Wells Fargo immediately closed my account and opened a new account over the phone. According to Wells Fargo, the XXXX transactions totaling {$600.00} ( each were for {$300.00} ) were done via XXXX and sent to someone I don't know. 
A day and a half later, Wells Fargo allowed these same XXXX transactions to post to my account causing the account to be in "" overdrawn '' status. The transactions were done through XXXX linked to my account. 
Today I am being told Wells Fargo reached out to XXXX and no fraudulent activity was observed so they were DENYING my claim dispute. I was not aware of any of this UNTIL WELLS FARGO XXXX DEPARTMENT REACHED OUT TO ME!!! 
Now my account is in overdrawn status, Wells Fargo refuses to do anything, and are refusing to close my account due to the overdrawn status!

I was refinanced by Wells Fargo back around 2015. They told me back then that if I made on time payments for 5 years that my house note would go down XXXX a month. They told me that it was to pay for lawyer fees for other refinance fees. I was just wondering if this had had anything to do with the Wells Fargo settlement. I really don't know if anything is owed to me as I know my insurance has went up over the years so my escrow account could have taken some of this amount.
4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"Wells Fargo showed that they closed my account for returning only 2 checks one check of {$500.00} deposited on XX/XX/XXXX, and a second check of {$550.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.

4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"I was targetted by XXXX XXXX and the XXXX  employees at the XXXX XXXX XXXX wells fargo branches on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. My checking account after it had been just opened on XX/XX/XXXX was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. My original account which I had opened in XXXX was in positive nothing wrong with it until when I couldn't log into my online banking. Wells fargo was letting XXXX XXXX get away with messing with my checking account and private business. But all these people tell me that wells fargo has a right to close your account. Well I had my first account open a year and they didn't exericise their right to close it, until XXXX XXXX targetted me. She was not in the bank exept on the last day when my new account was open on XX/XX/XXXX, this was a set up by the bank employees, to have me drive back and forth constantly. The police showed up and they looked confused at me that I wasn't bothering XXXX XXXX. But wells fargo still violated my civil rights by siding with XXXX XXXX and wrongfully closed my checking account. This is harassing me calling the police messing in my checking account and making me drive to the bank. While the whole time they were going to close my new account anyways. Now wells fargo refuses to do anything to XXXX XXXX and the wrong she did to me by falsely accusing me of harassing her. Wells fargo is responsible for her actions."
4/6/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"Cover Letter I am writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with the recent decision of Wells Fargo Bank ( WF ) to close my bank accounts and credit cards without any prior notice or explanation. This has caused me a great deal of inconvenience, stress, and has put me in a difficult situation.

I have been a loyal customer of WF for over 20 years and have always maintained a good standing with the bank. I have never had any issues with my account and have always paid my bills on time. However, I was surprised to receive a letter from the bank stating that my account had been closed due to "" internal policy reasons ''.

This decision has caused me a great deal of inconvenience as I have several pending transactions and bills that are due to be paid through this account. I have been left without access to my funds and have been unable to make any new transactions or payments.

Furthermore, the bank did not provide me with any explanation or warning regarding the closure of my account. This lack of communication has made it difficult for me to understand the reasons behind this decision and to take any necessary steps to rectify the situation. 

I request you to kindly investigate this matter and provide me with a satisfactory explanation as to why my account was closed. I also request the bank to provide me with the necessary support to resolve this issue and to ensure that I can access my funds and make any pending transactions as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, [ Name Redacted ] Background On XX/XX/2023, I received a notice from WF, NA ( See A ) that they will be unilaterally closing my only checking and savings accounts ( acct # s ending with [ Redacted ] & [ Redacted ] ). I have no other checking or savings accounts with any other financial institutions. I called the number to the Prevention Contact Center ( PCC ), which was included on the letter ( XXXX ) XXXX. I spoke to two individuals at the PCC, neither of these individuals were able to provide me with any information as to why this decision was made. They simply said, it was a business decision and had no further details.

The representatives referenced an agreement that I signed when I was a minor ( approximately seven years old ) that gave WF the unilateral ability to close a bank account at their discretion. During this phone conversation, I requested they send me a copy of this signed agreement and they agreed that I would receive a signed ( by me, [ Name Redacted ] ), within seven to 10 business days. It has not been 20 business days and I have not received the promised document. I then filed a complaint, and they provided me with the following complaint number # XXXX. 

That same day, I called the WF Executive Office of Prevention and spoke to a woman named XXXX. XXXX acknowledged that I have a good rapport with WF and have been a great customer for more than 20 years. She had no access to the information that could explain why my account was closed and simply provide a vague explanation of it being a business decision. 

The following day, XX/XX/2023, I called WF Corporate Customer service at ( XXXX ) XXXX and spoke to a woman named XXXX who provided me the Executive Customer Service phone number, which was ( XXXX ) XXXX. I called that number, which was, and spoke to an Executive Office Receptionist named XXXX. XXXX said that I should receive a call from a case specialist within a few days. 

After a few days, I received a call from Executive Office Case Specialist, XXXX XXXX and provided her with the complaint number ( # XXXX ). XXXX informed me that no complaint by that number was in WFs system and that no complaint had been created associated with my account, despite the Prevention Contact Centers assurances that one had been created. XXXX XXXX then created a complaint about the issue based on my concerns, which was ( # XXXX ). 

After working with XXXX XXXX for over a week, she called to inform me that there was nothing that she could do and that my checking and savings accounts would be closed as scheduled on XX/XX/2023. This is despite the fact that I have my mortgage with WF and I signed an agreement that I would pay my mortgage using my Well Fargo checking account ( acct # ending [ Redacted ] ). Later that day, I received a secure message from WF ( see B ). Within this notice, they attached an unexecuted Deposit Account Agreement that I never signed despite their promise to provide an executive agreement. 

Today, XX/XX/2023, I received in the mail two letters dated XX/XX/2023, that both credit cards I hold with WF were closed ( past tense ) without warning or notice ( see XXXX & XXXX ). This is even though I have a XXXX credit score ( according to WF ) of XXXX ( Excellent - nearly perfect ). Today, I called the number referenced on the letters, which was ( XXXX ) XXXX. Unfortunately, I did not get the name of the representative I spoke with. The person provided me with a generic scripted response that stated the following : WF prudentially performs ongoing and continual reviews to ensure our business relationships meet our standards and the intense standards of our regulators.

When I asked why I no longer met WFs standards, the representative stated, they are not required to give specifics. I expressed my frustration with this response and the representative quickly transferred me ( unable to get name ), to the WF Customer Advocacy Department. 

After a brief hold, I was transferred to a woman named XXXX ( possibly sic ) who essentially had me read the letter I received back to her, which states : As part of our normal business operations, we periodically review account information to ensure its accurate, complete, and meets our regulatory requirements. 

I then I told her I was more than willing to provide any information to ensure my WF account was accurate and complete. XXXX said there is no information that I could provide that could address this issue. I then asked what regulatory requirements do my credit card accounts not meet? Again, she was unable to answer this question. I then requested that she opened a complaint with her department, and she provided me with the following number : XXXX. She was not able to provide me with a timeline or an expectation on when I would be hearing back. 

Based on my previous experience, I do not expect to receive fair treatment from WF and therefore am requesting your attention to this matter at your earliest convenience."
4/6/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Once again I received your XXXX letter denying my claim and to produce FHA denial letter XXXX me. This is my last request for Wells Fargo to provide FHA denial letter. I do not want your Wells Fargo 's summary as Wells Fargo can not be trusted because Wells Fargo is a common thief that have lured its employees to lie on its behalf. You do not have a FHA denial letter from the Government of the United States who gave you its money to keep homeowners in their homes, therefore you continue to dance around said issue as you can not produce FHA denial letter. If you do not settle with me for stealing my home/asset for {$570000.00}, I will have no choice but to hire a skilled attorney and Wells Fargo will pay said attorney 's fees. Please note truth challenged Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX, the money that the U.S. Government won on my behalf and others who have been hurt by Wells Fargo -- YOU ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM LIABILITY IF YOU CONTINUE TO LIE TO KEEP YOUR EMPLOYMENT. Have you no honor? Wells Fargo should refrain from commercials at {$7.00} XXXX a pop x 20 times on one network and pay back the money to the people you have stolen from. DISGUSTING."
4/6/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"XXXX CLOSED????? 

I have more feedback on this issue. 

It is NOT RESOLVED YET. 

Wells Fargo claims "" We've been unable to establish contact with our customer, XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' They called but NEVER LEFT ANY MESSAGES on my voicemail. 

They then send a letter saying they are working on my issue. 

They LIED about trying to reach me. They made no effort to communicate like normal companies and leave a name and phone number. 

AND my big issue... .you allowed this case to CLOSE when it is IS NOT RESOLVED!

4/7/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"My mortgage was in an agreed eighteen month abeyance under the Covid program ( see attached letter ) Before it was due to expire I got in touch with Wells Fargo to commence repayment and to find out how the payments not made in the abeyance period were to be made good I got no clear answer with Wells Fargo suddenly talking about having to requalify for reinstating the mortgage and sending me documents about foreclosure and mortgage assistance, which I did not request. ( see enclosed ) Very alarmed at the turn this has taken which bears no connection with anything said or agreed at the start of during the process of abeyance. 

I called monthly to update Wells Fargo. I was expressly told that payments in abeyance could be tacked on to the end of the mortgage to pay at that time or if sold. 
Document 1 verifies that option."
4/7/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Background : I have a couple of business loans ( about XXXX ) in my corporations name with Wells Fargo that have been suspended since the pandemic began. I made regular payments on them before the pandemic. For three years since, I have made no payments. 

In XXXX of this year, the bank suddenly took about XXXX from my personal and business accounts and applied it to the loan. I called them and asked them to create a payment plan. They refused. They said they would come after my personal assets for the rest of the loan. I have no personal assets. In fact, after they emptied my accounts, I was at extreme risk of financial collapse. It was tantamount to a sudden and unproved violation that left a family of 4 on the brink of disaster. I pleaded with Wells Fargo to structure a repayment plan ( as I have done with many of my other credit lines ), but they intended to engage in this aggressive posture. My pleas fell on deaf ears.

The outcome I am looking at from this part of my complaint is for Wells Fargo to restore the funds to my accounts and engage in good-faith negotiations to structure a reasonable payment plan. At this point, I am faced with their belligerent threats to drive me into abject poverty by confiscating any and all of my existing or upcoming funds. I am at a loss as to why and how this is allowed. I am not a corporate entity with deep pockets. I have no employees. I am essentially a self-employed individual who has incorporated because of the demands of my profession. Please help me gain mental and emotional stability by limiting the banks ability to violate my family and me.

As an IT professional, I have a limited income and have struggled financially through the pandemic. I need assistance to stay on my feet and continue being a productive member of society. Please do what you can to provide guidance or move to remedy my situation with Wells Fargo to help ease my mind. This has been very difficult for my family and me emotionally, and I need any help I can get to navigate this challenging situation I have been thrust into."

4/7/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I was currently almost 18 months behind on my mortgage, receiving forbearance during various portions of that time period. When the pandemic hit, and the mortgage assistance programs were established by the government, we took advantage of that and remained on it while I was unemployed for the maximum amount allowable months to receive that assistance program. Now Wells Fargo is telling me I owe lump sump for those payments, totaling almost {$38000.00}. I am trying to go through a mortgage assistance program with them and be considered for loan modification, but don't feel as though the months covered under the pandemic relief program to protect home owners should now be thrown back in my face as if it were months I missed paying. I'd like to be considered for loan modification to start making payments again now that I am employed full time again, but feel like the XXXX  months I was behind should be what we operate off of. I am not completely well versed in the terms of the pandemic relief mortgage protection program we took advantage of, but feel like those months should be rolled to the back of the loan since the technical reason for not paying my mortgage was because I was protected by a government pandemic relief forbearance program. I am ready to resume making mortgage payments again, but wish to be treated fairly and not have the fact that I took advantage of an offered program during a hardship now be held against me."

I contacted Wells Fargo today XX/XX/XXXX. The first two people I spoke to ( one was the manager of the first ) told me that the money was on hold. The manager told me that the hold was due to the credit unions ' request due suspicious activity. She was unprofessional in her interaction with me. I told her it did not make sense my account showed that the credit unions had released the money on XX/XX/XXXX. Moreover, neither credit union had informed me of any suspicious activity. She was adamant that was nothing she could do. I was transferred to a third person to file a complaint. She told me that Wells Fargo had the money but that the hold was placed nevertheless due the large deposit being suspicious. I told her that I have banked with them for over 20 years and have made large deposits before. I asked her that if making two deposits instead of one or making a series of deposits different days totaling the same amount would have made a difference. 
She did not know what criteria was used or what is typically used since that is not her department. She said there was nothing she could do as the policies are in place to protect me. The deposits were drawn from accounts in my name and I have made deposits from those credit unions to Wells Fargo in the past."

4/8/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Dear Wells Fargo Bank, Thank you for your response to my XXXX claim, but I would like to further discuss the denial of my claim. Your response states that the transactions were made through a secured online banking session by me or someone whom I gave authorization to. However, I would like to reiterate that I did not give anyone permission to make this payment, and I have filed a police report and even undergone a lie detector test to prove my innocence. 

Additionally, when I contacted the bank, I was informed that all the XXXX accounts that the money was sent to have been disabled and that I was not tied to any of the emails registered under their XXXX. This suggests that my personal information was leaked, leading to someone sending the money from my bank. I would appreciate it if you could investigate the recipients ' accounts and provide me with more information to help clear my name. 

Furthermore, I want to emphasize that when the claims specialist called me, they informed me that my account was logged in from Texas and XXXX, despite me living in XXXX, Utah. The fact that my account was accessed from locations I have never been to before suggests that my account was compromised. I immediately changed my account username and password after being informed of this. 

In your response, you also mentioned that there was a history that the device that made the disputed XXXX transaction dated back more than 60 days, and that the same device was used after I changed my username and password without the online fraud claim assistance center. However, this does not prove that my account was not compromised and the money was sent to a strange account, as I have never authorized such transactions before. 

I kindly request that you take my situation seriously and investigate this matter thoroughly. I believe that I am not at fault, and I should not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions. Please let me know what further information or documentation I can provide to support my claim and help resolve this matter. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

4/8/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"Wells Fargo put a lock on our XXXX  card and refused to give us a reason as to why. I understand an account can be closed for any reason a bank choses but to not give us a reason after being a good customer for 5 years, never a late payment, and to eventually close the account and send it to the "" deceased '' dept is totally unacceptable customer service by the fraud dept. 
Due to a stolen check at another bank, I had to have my checking acct closed and re-opened with a new number. Caught in the changeover was my XXXX  payment ( {$2500.00} ) so a check got returned to my bank. As soon as I discovered this, I called WF and explained the situation and made payment directly from my new account. The pymt was received before the due date. Then my card was locked. Numerous attempts to try to find out why were never answered. They asked for another pymt and proof the pymt cleared and said they would lift the restriction, but when I complied with their request, they still would not unlock. I told them I would probably close the account and was told, they were "" thinking about closing it anyway '' ( no reason given ) and the next I knew I was reported as "" deceased '' on XX/XX/23. This might have caused numerous complications in our lives had I not been on top of this. Don't they need some kind of proof before declaring someone deceased? 
I feel it was vindictive on the part of the fraud mgmt ( but I have no proof ) other than the was they spoke with me on the phone. Customer service was beyond horrible in the fraud dept. If you pay your bill in full and are never late and take the cash back they offered, apparently they don't want your business."

I checked my saving account Monday, XX/XX/, no funds, nothing pending, Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX again, no funds and nothing pending. Wells Fargo denied receiving the wire. The sending Tittle company confirmed that funds were sent. It wasn't until the Tittle company traced the wire and confirmed that Wells Fargo received the funds, Wells Fargo admitted they had received the funds, {$430000.00} Wells Fargo then claimed that it looked suspicious ( The Wire ) is why the funds were held. The protocol for that bank is to notify the branch manager, The branch manager was to notify me. This was never done, the branch manager was never notified, when the branch manager inquired about the wire the bank denied receiving the wire. This caused a lot of stress. And time trying to figure out what happened to the wire. Those funds were to be used for purchasing another home the six day delay caused me finical hardship, ( increased interest payments ) Plus stress wondering what happened to my funds."
4/8/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"TRANSACTION HOLD BY WELLS FARGO BANK on XX/XX/XXXX I deposited XXXX checks into my business checking account at Wells Fargo, with a total amount of {$10000.00}. 

on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank wrote me a letter, stating that they are expecting "" a claim for the funds from the party that issued them, or their bank '', the remaining balance will be on hold in a "" temporary account ''. If a claim is NOT received within 60 days "" as expected '', they will mail me a cashiers check for the collected available balance in the account. 

on XX/XX/XXXX my account was closed. The remaining balance was taken by Wells Fargo into so called "" temporary account ''. 

on XXXX XXXX, because the waiting period of 60 days ended, I started to call Wells Fargo Loss Prevention , after getting transferred dozens of times, I was finally told to bring original checks to any Wells Fargo Branch . 

on XX/XX/XXXX, After going through my piles of mails, I finally found original checks and brought them to a banker, located at a local Wells Fargo branch. The banker scanned all my checks and uploaded them to the Loss Prevention department. Thereafter nothing happened. 

From XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, we made numerous phone calls to Wells Fargo. The only answer we got was to contact the check issuer to claim a refund from Wells Fargo. As a result, we made numerous phone calls and writings to the check issuer. In the end, the check issuer clarified that since the check was already CASHED, nothing needs to be done by the check issuer. 
Finally we were suggested to hire an attorney and sue Wells Fargo, because they actually deceptively took our money. 

on XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a demand letter to Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . asking for payment before going to court. 

on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call followed by email from XXXX, titled "" Wells Fargo Case Specialist Introduction '', stating that "" I am a Case Specialist in the Wells Fargo Enterprise Complaints Management Office. My role is to research and resolve your complaint. I wanted to let you know that I have started my research and that my goal is to provide you with a resolution on or before XX/XX/XXXX ''. 

on XX/XX/XXXX, early morning, I received a phone call and email from XXXX again, stating that "" Action was required from you in order to verify the items deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. The information was reviewed, and it was determined that in order to release the funds you must visit a branch location and provide two valid forms of identification. Please visit your nearest branch location to speak with a banker for further assistance '' on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, I appeared at Wells Fargo local Branch . I was there until past XXXX, during this time, the banker helped me make over dozens of phone calls, getting hung up, getting transferred, getting hung up again. The banker was very sympathetic, but all the phone calls didn't go anywhere ... .... 

on XX/XX/XXXX, I showed up at XXXX when this Wells Fargo XXXX opened. and I stayed there until XXXX. This time the banker was able to talk to XXXX. XXXX said she emailed my banker early morning. However, there was no clear instruction on what to do to get my refund check issued. After talking to my banker for a little while, XXXX transferred the phone call to another lady, and XXXX left. The other day told my banker that it takes XXXX weeks or longer to get the funds.My banker insisted to talk to someone who take actions, and finally, a gentleman answered the call. He said he handles the refund, but he can not be reached by phone, there is no personal extension number to reach this mysterious gentleman, and he has no idea what exact date my cashier 's check will be generated ... .. one lie after another lie. 
I truly believe that this whole thing is a lie. I waited 60 days from XX/XX/XXXX, nothing happened, although they promised to mail me a cashier 's check in 60 days. 
I delivered original checks to Wells Fargo branch on XX/XX/XXXX, the banker uploaded them into their system, nothing happened. 
Yesterday and Today, I am fooled, bringing two IDs into a local branch of wells fargo, again, nothing happened. 
If there is justice in this world, it is the US government and the Court.

I highly believe that CFPB and the Court will help me get my money back, also give Wells Fargo Penalties for violation of the law."

4/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Hello, I am writing to complain that Wells Fargo not once decided to investigate my case. My name is XXXX XXXX, the checking account I am writing this about is XXXX. This happened in late XXXX early XXXX when I contacted Wells Fargo about this issue. I no longer have an account with Wells Fargo because of their lack of accountability with this incident. My mother passed away in XXXX and I was granted life insurance money when she passed. Later that same year I began getting suspicious charges, which I had made several phone calls about. The charges were appearing as XXXX, totaling almost a whopping XXXX in fraudulent charges. Wells Fargo was going to look into the possibility of a fraudulent charges made without my consent, however, just 2 days after I called to complain about the very first incorrect charge, the representative I spoke to let me know that they had investigated and found there was no fraudulent action. This was unbelievable. Over XXXX of my mother 's money gone and it sounds absolutely ludicrous that every single transaction was investigated only after 2 days. I made several attempts to try to stop my account from being charged, even after my first call in refards to this issue, yet my funds kept disappearing. Wells Fargo also unfairly froze my account so I was unable to use it, but my funds still kept depleting ; I began to suspect this could have been done by one of your representatives themselves, obviously I was very concerned with already being denied any investigation after only 2 days. I changed my debit card, and I did everything your representatives told me to do. I finally made the decision to change my checking account, unfortunately, and later banked with another financial institution. I had called time and time again to have this investigated, but no one did anything for me. Not only was I treated unfairly, but none of your representatives actually looked into my case. It is not possible to make a complete and thorough investigation within only a day or two. I demand for this to be reopened and properly investigated. Every time I tried to call not only was I racially discriminated against on one occasion because of my name, but the people in the departments I was transferred to were also extremely unhelpful. XXXX, from your fraud department, never returned my calls nor did she ever even try to call me. This situation turned into a complete disaster because of the mismanagement of my case and the incorrect charges that kept being made even after complaining. Under the FDIC I shoul be able to have a proper investigation and demand my money back. This has been very tiring to deal with and I have suffered financially because of Wells Fargos incompetency. I went to the police and they told me this issue should be resolved by your bank, since it is insured under FDIC and so a police report would not be necessary. I did my own investigating and found very interesting reviews under the company name XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, which I made your representatives aware of to XXXX it themselves and they will see several reviews from others what I experienced in my account. I was also able to find a picture reported by the police in that county of the possible suspect that could have done this. This company 's name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX also appears on some of my transactions. Obviously, it fell on deaf ears. Ultimately, I should have never been denied a thorough and proper investigation on such a large amount of transactions after only a day or two of Wells Fargos so called investigation."

I ended up just paying the amount past due plus fees to avoid further issues. Wells Fargo was unable to resolve the issue. I now have received a collections notice for another past due property tax amount. Again, because the city of XXXX doesn't send me property tax bills, I rely on Wells Fargo to service the account. This is unacceptable and I have concern for those who are unable to advocate for themselves."

XXXXXXXX XXXX does not have record of the mortgage. However, XXXX referred me to XXXXXXXX XXXX as the loan servicer. Once again, XXXX XXXX ( attach ) now sent a letter stating they have no record of the mortgage. 

The federal regulations and guidelines specifically state that 3rd-party purchasers are entitled to the property free and clear of any liens on title. It has been more than 6 months since Wells Fargo, XXXX and XXXX have no solution in resolving this matter. I believe they are not compliant and maybe delaying the process due to not complying with federal regulations on XXXX 's.

On page two last paragraph Wells Fargo allowed an unauthorized 3rd party to speak on my behalf and make payment assistance options without me as the homeowner giving permission or signing consent which is a direct violation of my homeowner rights. Also in the same document Wells Fargo mentioned the reason they denied my modification was because they never received all of the necessary documents from loan lawyers. However on another email sent to me by XXXX XXXX  which are their attorneys mentions that the reason I was denied modification is because my loan is 3+ years delinquent with a credit decision post from XX/XX/XXXX. I wasnt in the house in XXXX, in fact I didnt purchase my property until XX/XX/XXXX. I have never received assistance, and I have never received a modification for my property.

I have included very important Documents and information which they are avoiding... 


This Complaint Im filing in response to complaint # XXXX, XXXX from Wells Fargos Executive Offices has failed to protect the public from Corporate Fraud I have attached a couple pages from her response, and Im going to show and prove that her response is Fraudulent and Wrong, and I will show you the corruption and Illegal activities that Wells Fargo did . 
PLEASE NOTE : THEY WERE FOUND GUILTY OF 11 FEDERAL FELONIES FOR THIS CORPORATE FRAUD Here is some solid proof, I had a court date to have a trial hearing with a 6 panel jury. 
I waited 2 months for this hearing, and then Out of the Blue The judge made a judgment decision in favor of Wells Fargo Why? Because Wells Fargo couldnt risk being expose to 6 people that could damage their reputation, You can see Wells Fargo compensated the Judge to make this decision. 
I did not even get a chance to fairly be heard in the court of law. Deep Corruption Shown here. 
Very important to make note of the most important phone conversations that would expose the illegal and unlawful actions. All conversations were recorded, yet they cant find the conversation between me and XXXX XXXX, Caused they destroyed it. 
1 When I called to get the information to submit payment for {$3100.00} per our agreement, I could not get a name and address that I was to mail this payment to, This is why they didnt receive this payment, No Wells Fargo person could give me this information. 
2 I was setup by Wells Fargo for a trial modification, HAMP This is where XXXX XXXX, WF Rep. 
told me to stop making my normal monthly payments I had been making for 12 years, then setup 3 automatic drafts for {$540.00}, these were completed, and Then I had to setup 4 more payments, Wells Fargo stated they needed more time. 
All these payments, and none of this money was applied to my loan, and you can see in their response, they admit to Not Accurately Stated and the letter sent to me provided inaccurate information. I was intentionally misled to make it look as payments werent being paid. 
Important Fact. No one could tell me what happen to the {$3800.00} automatically drafted out of my checking account, Where did it go.? This is Felony Theft done by wells Fargo. 
3 Here they try to claim that I could not afford my home with the new job I had. This is all False, XXXX XXXX, WF Rep. who I spoke with stated that he was going to set up my loan as a traditional loan, and that all my documentation show I can be approved for this loan, stated No more docs needed. I never heard from him again, and oddly Wells Fargo cant find any phone records of our conversation. Wells Fargo destroyed these records. Corporate Fraud. 
3a They stated they could not re-instate my loan because I couldnt afford it, Which was a Lie, I had over {$27000.00} in my checking account and would have had no issues making my payments.. 
This was done so they could process the foreclosure, Only to Financially benefit them. 
4 Never did I not respond, and I was calling them 5 times a week Statement is a Not True. 



5 Hard to believe that the 3 key people they were unable to find the phone conversations I Had with them, 1. With XXXX XXXX telling me to stop making my monthly payments, 2. With XXXX XXXX telling me he would have no problem with getting my loan approved, and 3. Most important, Me speaking with XXXX XXXX begging to allow me to send in a certified Cashiers Check, and Stop everything. Her response was.

I have reached out to Wells Fargo on numerous occasions, each time claiming they are not at fault. 

In providing its services, financial institutions as registered and licensed Payment Service Providers, are required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent banker.

4/10/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"In order to make a long story short, I will try to stick close to only the details. 

My mother passed in XXXX of 2020. My father passed in XXXX of 2020. This was a complete shock to me. 

I had a Power of Attorney for my father and an Affidavit of Heirship and I submitted this to the bank. 
At this time as well I was 5 months pregnant and my husband had just been in an accident and it was the middle of the pandemic and I lost my job. 
Wells Fargo said that they could help us by postponing our payments. They said that all we had to do was call in every 3 months and let them know if we still needed to freeze the payments and at the end I could get those payments put to the back of the loan. 
When the end of that came about I called and they told me there were steps that I needed to go through an assumption/modification. They told me that my credit wouldn't be a factor, they just needed proof of employment from my husband or I. They said my husband could be a non-barrower contributor. 
To make a long story short, every person almost that I was speaking with at Wells Fargo had a different story about what needed to be done, how much was owed and what the process was going to be to get everything in my name. 
I am a mother of XXXX and wife to XXXX but the misinformation has been so vast since dealing with them, it has kept me worried and on edge. The mortgage keeps going up and down even though it's supposed to be a fixed rate. They have asked me for the same documents at least 15 times and keep kicking me out of the modification program and making me start over again. They said I have not submitted my information on time but I have sent them through email and fax because they have not given me access to there portal because my name is not on the loan yet. Because my name is not on the loan, I have missed out of solar opportunities and home improvement opportunities. 
My husband and I moved into this home with my parents to help take care of my mother and then my father when he got ill. We had not intention on purchasing a home but now I don't want to loose my parents home because they keep putting me through a circus. I can't afford to pay a high mortgage amount but I can afford a low payment that we can maintain. 
I have a million things on my plate and this is just something hanging over my head and it feels like they are trying to make me loose the house. I don't want to pay high mortgage and my children don't have food to eat when they could modify the loan and make it affordable for us to keep my parents investment. 
It feels like these have got to be illegal activities and they are trying to push us into foreclosure instead of modification. 
My husband is veteran and we are struggling like most families right now and they have been making my grieving process and recovery from 2020 a worst experience than it already has been. I'm just asking them to be fair!"

The following morning, I was informed by Wells Fargo via email that they were no longer providing me with access to the funds from my deposited check until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, due to repeated overdrafts on the account within the past 6 months ; however I have their "" Clear Access '' bank account.

'' Furthermore, no where in the banking agreement does it state the amount of "" overdrafts '' that would justify a XXXX log day hold on a deposit and Wells Fargo defines an overdraft as "" when you do not have enough available money in your account to cover a transaction, but we pay it anyway. '' No overdraft has ever been paid on this account because it does not allow overdrafts. The funds have already cleared the account that they were pulled from.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached an agreement with Wells Fargo Auto to settle my outstanding debt for my auto loan through an accord and satisfaction agreement. Despite this agreement, Wells Fargo Auto has continued to demand payment and has even threatened to repossess my vehicle. 

Additionally, Wells Fargo Auto has been purposely misapplying my payments, resulting in inaccurate account balances and additional fees. This behavior is a clear violation of consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 

Furthermore, my research has revealed that Wells Fargo has a history of similar behavior. In XXXX, the CFPB fined Wells Fargo {$100.00} million for opening unauthorized accounts and charging customers for services they did not request. This is evidence of a pattern of unethical and illegal behavior by Wells Fargo, which warrants further investigation and action by the CFPB. Most recently they have been charged again for illegal practices, their executive office is unprofessional and uneducated and poses a threat to the life and liberty outlined in the Constitution of this great Nation. Accord and Satisfaction is a write of the people to discharge debt and their ignorance of the law is no excuse in law. 

I request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Wells Fargo Auto for their failure to honor an accord and satisfaction agreement, their intentional mishandling of payments, and their violation of consumer protection laws. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I sent $ XXXX on XX/XX/22 and then another $ XXXX on XX/XX/22. I have the backup to support if needed, as do the other XXXX investors. 

Around XX/XX/22 it was discovered by XXXX investors that XXXX was a fraud, and we took action to call the FBI, SEC, and local Attorney Generals. The SEC has now formally charged XXXX 's creator, and I've added the SEC link below. XXXX XXXX created a Ponzi Scheme and XXXX investors were part of it. However, the banks involved did not protect the consumer from fraud and there were many ways which they could have prevented the {$4.00} million in losses. 

I have filed two complaints with CFPB to Wells Fargo, and both were rejected. I can't get anywhere with Wells Fargo and they refuse to cooperate. Unfortunately, no current legal action has been taken against the banks. They did not protect the consumer and I would like the CFPB to step in and take action on the investors ' behalf. 

Wells Fargo, XXXXXXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX  all accepted wires for XXXX XXXX, which is now charged as a Ponzi Scheme by the SEC. These banks did not perform proper due diligence on the accounts they created for XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, did not examine the line of business and legitimacy behind the company they created an account for, they did not flag the various large dollar value transactions to put a hold on the account ( until it was formally required to do so under investigation ), but most notably, these banks did not protect the consumer from fraud. Protecting the consumer has been reiterated multiple times in prior cases the CFPB has ruled on, as being the primary purpose of the board 's existence. 

In three prior cases I've found ( XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX ), each case ends with an overall delivery stating that it's the banks ' responsibility to protect consumers. Banks are being held accountable for turning a blind eye to fraud, and ultimately not protecting the consumer, both of which are truths from the XXXX case. I've attached my letter to an attorney. I have not found an attorney to take on a class action against the banks, mainly because most of them already had pending litigation vs Wells Fargo. 

I'm turning to the CFPB to assist the XXXX  investors and charge these banks for their part in the XXXX Ponzi Scheme.

We had the phone number and email changed to my daughter 's. We shortly received an email from Wells Fargo about recurring payments that may be affected by the new card. There were 14 different recurring payments that I did not approve or know about. They include XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Planet Fitness, Audible, XXXX, XXXX Play, XXXX, XXXX, and several others. I do not have a computer or cell phone, and I do not have internet. I don't even know what these are. There were several large withdrawals for XXXX XXXX also. About 2 weeks later, Wells Fargo mailed a letter stating that they had completed the research of the inquiry about those charges, and that they found that all those charges were made by someone that had permission. I literally could not believe it. In no way, shape or form did I approve any of those. Wells Fargo decided that since the person that did this to me is my granddaughter, that I approved it. I most certainly did not approve any of it. There is no way Wells Fargo actually did any kind of investigation. My husband and I have been members of Wells Fargo since XXXX. If the investigators bothered to go over our account for the past 40 years, they would see that there were never any charges like that at all-until after my husband passed away. I invite Wells Fargo to come to my home to see that I do not have internet or even drive. I beg Wells Fargo to come to the town I live in so they will see that it is very small, and we don't have several of the things that were charged to me. I assure you I have never been to any XXXX XXXX. Did the investigators check with XXXX XXXX? I will gladly send you my picture. I have never been there. If the investigators had actually investigated, they would see that XXXX is not even available in XXXX, Virginia. I do not know what XXXX is, and I do not know anything about XXXX XXXX. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX. All of these charges add up to over {$17.00}, XXXX. That money was the life insurance money that I received when my husband passed away. He proudly served in the XXXX XXXX. I was in the hospital for 3 days last month. I need to save whatever money I have for medical bills. If I ever have to go into a XXXX home, I will need that money. I have hospital bills that are due now. I have at least XXXX different medications I have to pay for. When Wells Fargo sent their documents relating to the investigation, there was no actual investigation. They just listed the date a new card was requested, and that the phone number was changed, etc. That's exactly why a new card was requested and why the phone number was changed-because Wells Fargo allowed over {$17000.00} to be stolen from my account. I wanted to go in person, but the Wells Fargo in XXXX, Va closed in XXXX. I am now over an hour away from another Wells Fargo. Did the investigators contact XXXX Play, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Planet Fitness or any of those to see if I was involved in any way? No, they did not. If you look at the statements, you can see where many of the transactions were made, and they were nowhere near my home. I even had doctors appointments on XXXX of those days in XXXX, Va. I do have proof of my doctors ' visits. I do also have proof of the days I was in the hospital. Do the investigators really think a XXXX XXXX XXXX widow with no internet that can't XXXX XXXX approved XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and all the others? There is literally no way they did any kind of investigation. Please check our statements from XXXX. My husband and I paid our insurance, medical bills, groceries, and only what was necessary. I am attaching documents of everything I have included in this statement. I only get a small social security check each month. Thank you for your time & help."

As a XXXX person with low visibilty, I was forced to get a ride and go into a Wells Fargo location to deal with the issue. I was at that location for 6 hours to get the account unfrozen. I live in pain and this was more than difficult for me. 

Well Fargo never told my why the account was frozen for no reason. 

Only six months after finally unfreezing my account, Wells Fargo closed my account without any notice in XX/XX/XXXX. I once again had to get a ride to go to the local branch in person to get my money out and they made it very difficult and it took another 7 hours. I was forced to spend a week as a XXXX person to open a new account elsewhere for my direct deposits for XXXX. 

Again they did not tell me why they closed the account. 

I am aware the XXXX has levied XXXX XXXX for many fraud activities by Wells Fargo for freezing and closing accounts for no reason.

4/12/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX  telling me that my DSL service was being disconnected and XXXX XXXX XXXX had sent {$330.00} to my account as a debit and they wanted to fix this error. 

They asked me to wire the money back to them immediately. There was a lot of discussion about how this happened and I asked them for verification of who they were. 
They TOLD ME that they could show me my bank account at Wells. I hadn't told them that I banked with Wells. I thought that they had my banking details because they were XXXX and XXXX has my bank details as the are my DSL service provider. 

They gave me a XXXX for Wells to confirm what they said was true. I entered the URL and suddenly my account popped up on my screen. This further confirmed my belief that they were real. They said that the ACH to me was delayed and would be here tomorrow at XXXX XXXX. 

Before I knew it, they told me at the same thing happened for {$2600.00} and asked me to wire {$2900.00} which was the combined total of both. Told me to go to an XXXX website to see the amounts on their Recovery List. My company name, XXXX XXXX, was listed there with each of the two amounts. 

The next thing I know is a wire form was presented to me partially filled out. They told me that the bank was going to confirm this transaction. The bank called me and gave me a number to enter release the funds. 

As I entered the amount of the wire, the wire amount jumped to the total amount of both transactions with {$2900.00} to {$29000.00} ( appx ). I tried to backspace to correct the but the return key would not. I challenged them and they said they would wire the full amount back to me. 

They were very smooth talkers and it was an hour and a half before I knew it. 

Within a few minutes, they told me to check my account again. The account showed the full amount of the wire in the Pending area of the page. 

We agreed that they would make sure this was handled correctly. 

We agreed to talk at XXXX the next morning. 

On Friday when I got up, i checked my account and the pending wire had disappeared and there was a {$25000.00} debit to my checking account. 

I called XXXX, the person who I was talking to on XXXX  and screaming at him. 

He apologized and told me he would get me the {$25000.00} immediately. They played the same routine and set up the wire forms with the amount blank and me waiting for clearance from the bank. Again they reassured me that I would get the funds that day. 

On Friday, I checked my accounts and found nothing from them but {$25000.00} missing from my personal account. I blew up and he reassured me that this was all a mistake of XXXX XXXX XXXX  and you know how strong they are so don't worry. 

After several calls with them, I began to realize that I was involved in a wire fraud group. 

I called Wells to see if they could stop the wire. When they said no, I asked for the fraud department and gave them a full report. For the record. no one from Wells has been in touch with me since my first report. 

I next called the receiving bank who told me that the funds were immediately sent to Resolute. I tried getting someone on the phone but there was no response. 

I have some of the paperwork and notes available."

4/12/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I'm a XXXX year old semi-retired XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from your Claims Assistance Center stating that my fraud claim regarding an online advance totaling {$9900.00} on my credit card ending in XXXX had been denied. It went on to state Our research shows the advance was made through a secure online banking session by you or someone who had your authority and that no other processing errors occurred. Based on this information, we determined the advance was authorized. We have closed your claim. 

The actual fraud, however, involved more than a simple advance on my credit card. Your banks subsequent efforts to correct the damage have messed up my account balances almost beyond recognition and have proven your inability to sort out what really happened. If you dont understand what happened, it would logically follow that you wouldnt discern that a fraud took place. All three of my Wells Fargo accounts ( checking, savings and credit card ) were involved in fraudulent activity, with unauthorized transactions occurring on all three. 

The fraud occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. My computer was attacked by a virus that locked my screen and displayed a pop-up warning from XXXX that my computers would be locked if I didnt call XXXX at XXXX ( see exhibit 1 - attached screen shot ). When I called the number, I was instructed to download some software to enable the agent to connect to my computer and check it out. Giving access via software downloads is a normal practice when you work with any technical support group. The agent ran some programs that appeared to show me that my computer was infected by viruses and under attack by someone trying to hack my computer, but that my XXXX warranty would allow them to fix it for free if I would first purchase a software license that they would reimburse me for. 

To prove that I wouldnt have to pay, they offered to transfer the reimbursement to my account in advance if I would give them the account number. I expected they might transfer perhaps XXXX or XXXX XXXX dollars when I gave them my checking account number ( there was only about {$150.00} in it at the time ). I was stunned when I checked the account on my phone and saw {$2000.00}. I thought there might be something suspicious going on but now I thought I was in possession of {$2000.00} that didnt belong to me that I needed to get out of my account. They then told me I would have to buy gift cards and read them the numbers on the back so that they could pay for the license. 

I then told them I would check my saving account to make sure they didnt simply transfer the {$2000.00} I had there to my checking. In fact this is exactly what they had done without my authorization, however, unknown to me, they quickly transferred the {$2000.00} back to savings ( again without my authorization ) so I would see it there. They next transferred {$9900.00} from my credit card ( without authorization ) to my checking account, then transferred {$8000.00} back to my credit card ( again without my authorization ) leaving an unauthorized {$2000.00} in my checking account. Consequently, when I checked again, I could see both my intact {$2000.00} in savings and another {$2000.00} in checking, which I assumed was their money. I had not thought of checking my credit card since I dont think Id ever even used it ( it had a XXXX balance at the time ) and couldnt imagine how they would get access to it even had that thought occurred to me. 

In any event, at this point I had {$2000.00} in my account that I was positive didnt belong to me. Was this legit or were these people manipulating me to launder money. I couldnt be sure, but I was certain I needed to purge it from my account. Consequently, I did as I was told and withdrew the {$2000.00} ( which was the result of an unauthorized charge on my card and unauthorized transfer to checking ) from my checking account at my local branch. I then purchased XXXX {$500.00} XXXX gift cards at XXXX and read them the numbers from the back of the cards. 

That night I woke up in the middle of the night convinced that I had been the victim of a fraud. I called Wells Fargo when I saw the transactions on my credit card and reported the fraud and changed my passwords. I also reported the fraud to the Internet Crime Complaint Center ( IC3 ). These actions should provide proof that I wasn't trying to defraud Wells Fargo. My quick action in alerting Wells Fargo saved your company from paying out on thousands of dollars worth of transactions that had been charged to my card during the night. I didnt bother reporting to the local police as the fraudsters could have been located anywhere in the world. 

The reason Im appealing your decision is that none of the transactions that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX were authorized by me with the possible exception of the cash withdrawal from the local branch. However, even that was a withdrawal of funds that were fraudulently placed in the account. Im attaching photocopies of the gift cards with the numbers on the back scratched off. Wells Fargo should have red flagged the fact that a credit card account, that had never been used, suddenly got maxed out. Why wasnt I alerted with a text message? Why wasnt the teller who gave me the cash alerted that there was an unusual transaction on my account. Had she asked me if I had withdrawn the maximum {$10000.00} from a credit card, that had never previously been used, that day I would have realized I was being scammed and wouldnt have withdrawn the funds. 



Subsequent Events When I received the denial letter, I checked my accounts and found that I had a {$2000.00} charge left on my credit card. I called the number on the letter to ask that you send me documentation of the reason my claim was rejected. A sympathetic rep told me to hold off and she would see if she could get the claim decision reversed. In the meantime, I had withdrawn most of my funds from my accounts since I feared they might be garnished. I was delighted to find that on XX/XX/XXXX a set of reversal transactions had been entered to credit my charge for {$9900.00} plus interest charges. I assumed my appeal had been successful. However, my accounts now showed that you owed me {$8000.00} instead of me owing you {$2000.00}. 

A few days later, while I was on vacation in XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called you long distance to try to sort things out. I spent an hour on the phone being switched from one person to another until I got connected to someone who I believe was in the fraud unit. They said that they would file a report to eliminate the {$8000.00} that I was credited in the account. 

Unfortunately, when I checked again a little over a week ago, I found that someone had posted a debit of {$9900.00} to my checking account while I still had the {$8000.00} credit on my charge card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried calling again ( I called XXXX ) and was again bounced around to several people including a XXXX and a XXXX and was given a reference number ( XXXX ). It seems some people can access my checking account, others can access my credit card, but no one can make a correction to both. The last person I spoke with ( didnt catch the name ) finally said that I owe {$2000.00} and thats it ''. Then she hung up on me. 

If the fraud claim is resolved properly with my claim being completely granted, my accounts should have the following balances 1. Business Checking {$60.00} 2. Business Market Rate Savings - {$4.00} 3. Business Card {$0.00} I would prefer not to have to cancel my accounts and my relationship with your bank but will be forced to do so if my claim isnt granted. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed an appeal packet to the address displayed on a Wells Fargo Appeal Request Form I downloaded via a XXXX search. It was returned to me as "" not deliverable as addressed '' on XX/XX/XXXX."
4/12/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to make an online mortgage payment with Wells Fargo. I was unable to make the payment and got an error message saying NO PAYMENT REQUIRED DUE TO PANDEMIC COVID-19 FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS. There was no way to bypass this to make the payment so I called into customer service. The rep told me there was a request to suspend payments, and I advised that I had no need to suspend payments and I never requested a forbearance. He apologized, removed it from my account, and I set up a payment with him. 

I didn't think much about it, until XX/XX/XXXX when I actually needed to do the forbearance. I called into customer service and got a 3 month forbearance. However, when I got my confirmation paperwork in the mail, imagine my surprise when it stated that this was my 2ND 3 MONTH FORBEARANCE! I immediately called in, disputing this, saying that I had never missed a payment and never requested a previous forbearance. 

This issue has been escalated at least 3 times during the process, with everyone telling me that my call into customer service was to REMOVE A REQUESTED FORBEARANCE, when in all actuality, the call was made because I was unable to make my regular monthly payment No one can give me proof that I requested the original forbearance. The forbearance that I am in now, I got a ton of paperwork confirming the forbearance and what happens next. I never got anything like that with the "" 1st forbearance. '' So now that I actually need the help, I am getting shorted 3 months in error. To be clear, I never missed a payment on my mortgage. But with shorting me 3 months in error, on the off chance that I actually NEED that extra time, I could end up in foreclosure based on that error! 

I have asked for confirmation or proof that I enrolled in the forbearance, and all I'm being told is that it was put on my account on XX/XX/XXXX and I called in requesting removal on XX/XX/XXXX ( which is the date I called because the online would not take my payment ). 

I definitely need assistance with this issue."

In this regard, we have received several emails messages from the bank advising us to provide a legitimate US address which I updated on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Nevertheless, in spite of having complied with the bank 's request my account was definitely closed on XX/XX/XXXX, and I have not received my money back as of yet to the given address. 

We consider this issue has taken very long for the bank to give us a positive response, and consider this has been an unethical and discriminatory management practice and lack of corporate responsibility by Wells Fargo bank to hold our balance, since we did comply with the bank 's requirement, and thus demand that our money be sent immediately to the given US address. 

We truly appreciate your valuable support in solving this matter at your earliest convenience.

In XXXX, I received a check from Wells Fargo Auto with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}. I began contacting Wells Fargo to let them know this amount doesnt compensate me. Nor does it make up for the impact that their illegalities have had on my life. I have only received rude refusals from Wells Fargo to date, and in one XXXX  call a representative questioned my Covid status. 

As a victim of Wells Fargo Dealer Services, I was negatively impacted by the lies and deception of Wells Fargo Bank. As an XXXX XXXX  citizen and tax-payer, I'm appalled that Wells Fargo Bank was allowed to discriminate against me and so many others for so long. I suffered a devastating loss that I'm yet to recover from, and it cost me dearly. 

I remember how they held my check when I bought my car and the dealer was instructed not to release the vehicle. I remember how they argued with me when I wanted to discuss payment options causing me mental anguish and emotional distress. I remember how my father, a US Veteran of the XXXX XXXX, had to help me financially when Wells Fargo refused to grant me hardship when I lost employment. 

I remember XXXX weekend of XX/XX/XXXX, getting the call that Wells Fargo ordered repossession of my XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The person who called me, told me coldly that I had a small window to get my belongings. I remember subsequently losing my job the next month because I didn't have a car. I remember subsequently being evicted and being homeless for the next few years, surfing from couch to couch relying on my family because I didn't have a car. I remember my small business grinding to a stop, losing countless opportunities. I remember losing my parents trust, and how I had to explain how Wells Fargo acted. I remember my father saying how it seemed shady. 

What I endured as a result of Wells Fargo and their "" gaming '' and what they've done to my trust as not only a consumer but as a citizen, is traumatic. Their actions forced me into bankruptcy. 

In a XXXX  phone conversation with XXXX # XXXX, I was gamed when Wells Fargo disregarded my consumer rights. I requested the default terms of my loan and was informed by someone named XXXX that they would be mailed to me. I never received my terms via mail. I also requested extension on my payment date to redeem my car. I was informed by XXXX # XXXX that Wells Fargo is not required by law to contact me regarding their decision to grant me an extension on my account. 

XXXX informed me that I was granted an extension until XX/XX/XXXX. However I was never informed of this decision by Wells Fargo. The car moved to auction and I never received the requested information from Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX - XXXX received my offer of XXXX to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. She informed me that two solutions exist, 1 ) email an offer and wait 2-3 biz days for response or 2 ) speak with collection specialist to receive a decision. I was transferred to XXXX to speak with a collection specialist representative as XXXX reported only specialist could make a decision on my offer. 

XXXX, the collection specialist stated that XXXX gave bad and/or erroneous information. He reported that he had no role in the process. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with representative # XXXX XXXX who informed me that XXXX was unavailable and that she could not confirm the process or provide further information. She only confirmed my offer of XXXX being submitted. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I placed a call to Wells Fargo and made an offer of a payment of XXXX to redeem my vehicle. The representative refused to document my offer. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  by a representative that I must make payment before XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  or else my vehicle would be auctioned. This contradicted a court letter that informed that the car would not be auctioned on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  if the account has not been settled. 

XXXX, a Wells Fargo collections rep, stated that he had no knowledge of redemption process given to me by XXXX. I was transferred to XXXX a Wells Fargo Collection representative who stated that XXXX was his supervisor. He stated that everyone I spoke with provided wrong and/or erroneous information. He stated that he will not supply the terms or policies in writing, citing what he called legal nature of letterhead. '' XXXX stated that he could make no negotiations on behalf of Wells Fargo. 

All of these communications equated to gaming tactics meant to willfully violate my consumer rights. I lost relationships, wages, housing, and opportunities due to to these illegal tactics. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I was awaiting XXXX  XXXX, a specialist with Wells Fargo, to return my call regarding this dispute. That call never came. Subsequent calls were negative, and I was being laughed off of the phone. As of XX/XX/XXXX, Im still seeking adequate compensation and Wells Fargo has even declined to share their arbitration clause. 

I'm seeking adequate compensation from Wells Fargo and have made several unsuccessful attempts contacting Wells Fargo to resolve this matter. I'm seeking assistance from my representatives in contacting Wells Fargo and working toward a resolution. By contacting my US Representative and the US Treasury Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, I want to share how Wells Fargo 's illegal actions and gaming tactics have detrimentally impacted my life. 

I've received check with the memo XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$48.00}. Im demanding an additional {$920000.00} for compensation plus {>= $1,000,000} for future medical expenses. This amount will restore lost housing, transportation and opportunities as well as begin to help me recover from the immense amount of stress that resulted from Wells Fargo illegal actions."
4/12/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,Wells Fargo Bank had closed my checking account and also closed my old credit card issued by them. It was caused by WF check was stolen. They opened new checking account and new credit card per their advice. I always had both as automatic payment from my checking account. Bank rep. XXXX at the branch arranged all she told me she arranged automatically payment to the credit card just like before years. She suggested to take care one XXXX XXXX XXXX by myself. I agree it. Now after a mo. I got a new bill on XX/XX/23 and they charged me $ XXXX late fee and interest {$5.00} I called immediately and they said they will not be able to correct.

The payment was received by Wells Fargo into my correct account XXXX but at an incorrect amount of {$0.00} ( XXXX Cent ), indicative that bank personnel affected an offsetting net-zero debit transaction to steal the funds and eliminate the reporting requirement for the transaction, but did an inept job of even theft leaving the telltale {$0.00}."
4/12/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"In end of XXXX, 2023, I received a letter from Wells Fargo advising that they would be closing my checking and savings account in XXXX ( although they "" reserve the right to close the accounts sooner '' ). The letter referred to a "" recent review of our account relationship '' and "" the bank 's responsibilities to manage risks in its banking operations. '' No further explanation was provided. I have been a customer for well over a decade. There have been no recent changes to my accounts or activity. There have been no accusations by me of any fraudulent activity. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and not involved in any business or personal activities that could be considered "" high-risk. '' There is no apparent reason why my accounts were closed in such an abrupt and disruptive manner. Neither I, nor the banker at our branch, have been able to determine what prompted this decision. The sudden account closure has caused significant turmoil resulting from the requirement to open a new account with another financial institution and, thereafter, notify each of the many companies we are doing business with of the changes, so as not to disrupt our ongoing responsibilities for mortgage, utility, and the many other payee/payer relationships associated with our routine life."
4/12/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/2023, I went to a Wells Fargo ATM at XXXX to make a withdrawal. I initially attempted to make a withdrawal for {$200.00}, all XXXX dollar bills, no receipt. I received {$60.00}. I thought I must have pressed the wrong button so I made another attempt at a withdrawal, this time in the amount of {$150.00} with a receipt. I again only received {$60.00}. I looked at my online account and it showed both transactions, {$200.00} and {$150.00} respectively. I immediately called Wells Fargo and filed a claim, explained what happened. They told me it would take up to ten days to get my money back. I followed up a couple of times and was told they are investigating. After the ten days had passed, I called the claims department on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told my claim was denied and would not be refunded. I explained to them again what happened, and I got the same response. This is unacceptable, I got robbed by the same bank that I have trusted with my money. Im not sure what else I can do. Please help me get my money back. Thank you"
4/12/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"There were many times with Wells Fargo that my account balance was incorrect. When I would deposit money the amount on the receipt would be different to the app on my phone even after a couple of days. Also there has been times when my account was frozen due to suspected fraudulent charges when it was not the case, when I have used {$400.00}"
4/12/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,Wells Fargo closed my business secured credit card. I have XXXX savings to cover the secured card. They charged interest and an over draft fee even though they closed it over 30 days. I contacted them and told them to take my {$1000.00} because at closing I only had a balance of {$970.00} which is less than my security deposit. They owe me money.

I immediately sent an escrow payment of {$50.00} additional dollars ( XXXX - XXXX = XXXX ). Next, on my XXXX regularly scheduled mortgage payment I added an additional {$100.00} to regular scheduled XXXX escrow payment = XXXX. Again, an additional {$100.00} to escrow shortage, ( XXXX - XXXX = XXXX ). Next, I was sent the escrow analysis on XX/XX/2023 with projected figures for escrow for XXXX which states my escrow is short by {$240.00}? In addition on their ( Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX ) the {$340.00} I regularly pay has a skip month of XXXX in which the company backs out the {$340.00} each year? I confirmed this in my records from previous years and see that I have paid each XXXX  Escrow of {$340.00} each of the last XXXX years and Wells Fargo has backed out this payment annually to nowhere? The company calculates my escrow yearly as {$340.00} x XXXX = {$3800.00} yet I pay {$340.00} x XXXX = {$4100.00}. I called immediately to clarify as this would clearly means I'd have an overage of estimated escrow, {$340.00} - XXXX = {$250.00} overage! In explaing this to XXXX, employee # XXXX she simply stated, "" that's when Wells Fargo zeros everything out for the escrow year, '' what? I requested a supervisor and XXXX hung up! I sent in similar said complaint to Wells Fargo for immediate recalculation and insertion of XXXX 's estimated {$340.00} and have had XXXX response. In addition I have on record XXXX additional years where {$340.00} has been backed out to nowhere?"
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a small savings bond left to me by my father that was several months past maturity. I know the banks dont like giving up large amount of cash so I didnt cash them all at the same time. 
XX/XX/XXXX I deposited XXXX more bonds into my account. Not a problem at all. 
Then Approx. XX/XX/XXXX I deposited another savings bond into my Wells Fargo account. 
The next morning I checked on my account because I was going to send my son birthday money and they said that they froze my deposit account and that they were closing both my accounts. 
When I called the bank they referred me to their loss prevention/fraud dept. which they could not tell me anything. They could not give me a solid reason why. The only thing they said was that the bond had been altered. It had not been altered. It wasnt any different than the other ones I deposited. The bonds had been stored in a safe for 10 years and then after that I had them in a metal lock box in my bedroom closet for over 20 years. They were in an envelope and they were almost brand new looking. Besides smelling a bit like musty or aged paper. They hadnt even been folded or touched by human hands since my father passed away in XXXX. 
The bank informed me that after 60 days they would send me a check for my funds ( bond money ) IF no one filed a claim against my money. Well I was upset but I knew that I would get the money in 60 days and it would be fine since no one could file a claim on my bond since the bond belonged to me purchased by my father. Rightfully mine. The treasury dept cashed them. Wells Fargo even cashed XXXX of them previously. 
So after 60 days I waited patiently for a check to come in the mail for my bond money. I have it well over XXXX weeks and finally I contacted them via email ( see attachment ). XX/XX/XXXX. I got a general account update Response. 
I contacted them again with the exact same letter but sent to a different email address. I receive a response in XXXX that said we need more time to respond to your concerns. And will follow up by XX/XX/XXXX th. 
I received a response later but was informed that the response they sent me will expire and that I wont be able to access it after a certain date. I do know if I screen shot the response. But I do know the response I received was from a completely different situation involving the XXXX XXXX nevada branch and how they marked my bonds paid and then refused to deposit them. ( Thats a different situation Im not going to Pursue because I sent my bonds into the treasury and they honored them and they got cashed ). 
Anyway so the bottom line is they have not returned my savings bond money for my last bond. Additionally what they also did was report me to early warning system making it very hard to open a bank account now."
4/13/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Gentleman, I am following up with you concerning XXXX XXXX. 

Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX Mortgage continue to deny that they are the appropriate company at issue. 

Along with my synopsis of this case, I am resubmitting corroboration documents substantiating that Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX Mortgage are Explicitly, Unquestionably, and Undeniably the appropriate company at issue. 

1. I have attached the most recent document submitted to the Trial Court "" XX/XX/XXXX '' from Wells Fargo 's Counsel XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Wells Fargo continues to DENY that it is the appropriate company at issue, but the "" Motion To Substitute Party Plaintiff '' filed by Wells Fargo 's Counsel XXXX XXXX XXXX confirms that Wells Fargo is indeed the appropriate company at issue. This is irrefutable. 

THIS IS AN ONGOING LITIGATED MATTER INITIATED BY WELLS FARGO. 

Wells Fargo has deliberately filed this "" Motion to Substitute Party Plaintiff '' in the hopes of evading its Unlawful, Predatory Mortgage Servicing Practices and Wrongful Foreclosure action against me. 

As evidenced in the attached 5th Circuit Court of Appeal Ruling, Wells Fargo Failed to Establish it is the proper party to enforce the Promissory Note at issue. 

WELLS FARGO HAS FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE OWNERSHIP IN THE NOTE AND MORTGAGE AT ISSUE. 

Wells Fargo had no authority or legal right to assign The Note and Mortgage at issue in which it has not proven ownership in. THIS IS FRAUD AND AN ILLEGALITY. 

I am also attaching the Transfer Of Note Secured By Mortgage from XXXX To XXXX Mortgage in the amount of {$110000.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am also attaching the Corrective Assignment of Mortgage Note from XXXX to Wells Fargo Dated XX/XX/XXXX which has been fraudulently altered to {$210000.00}. 

Both Assignments are False, Forged, Fraudulent and Fabricated Assignments. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX FABICATED AND FORGEDTHE CORRECTIVE ASSIGNMENT. 

The Originator, XXXX Mortgage was not in existence at the time the said documents were executed. XXXX Mortgage was defunct in XXXX. 

This substantiates the fact that the assignments are False, Forged, Fraudulent and Fabricated. This is Irrefutable. THIS IS FRAUD AND AN ILLEGALITY. 

WELLS FARGO, XXXX XXXX AND XXXX SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR EGREGIOUS ACTIONS. THIS IS UNLAWFUL. 

XXXX Mortgage continues to Deny that it is not the proper party at issue as well. I am attaching two Affidavits of Amounts Owed from XXXX and one Affidavit of Amounts Owed from XXXX Mortgage that were submitted to Wells Fargo to pursue foreclosure against XXXX XXXX. As evidenced in the 5th Circuit of Appeals Ruling, the Affidavits were INVALIDATED. 

XXXX XXXX AND XXXX MORTGAGE ARE EXPLICITLY, UNQUESTIONABLY, AND UNDENIABLY THE APPROPRIATE COMPANY AT ISSUE HERE AS WELL. 

XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  have placed Forced Placed Insurance on my property in which they have no legal right to do so. 

THIS IS FRAUD AND AN ILLEGALITY. 

I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter. 

Kindest Regards, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX"
4/13/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"on XX/XX/13, I opened a statement for a Wells Fargo active cash visa signature card. The balance is XXXX, which all of the transaction made during the month of XXXX. 

That same day, XX/XX/13, I reported the fraud to Wells Fargo. I also reported the fraud to all three of the credit bureaus. 

One of the agents on the phone indicated to also make a report on FTC.gov. On that website, it directed me to CFPB."
4/13/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,None,"On Monday XX/XX/2023, I was scammed at a XXXX XXXX. The aggressor took my phone from my hands and sent herself {$1500.00}. The agreed amount was {$100.00}. She took advantage of me and intimidated me to trick me into sending her money. 

That night I made the claim with Wells Fargo and soon after made one with the police. Wells Fargo almost a month later closed my claim. They said they do not accept police reports as support for their investigation."
4/13/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"During Early XXXX I had a loan with XXXX which was later bought by Wells Fargo, In XXXX my house was sold in foreclosure. Multiple times Wells Fargo had me sending in documents over and over, They never gave me a modification even with all the government programs, they just had me starting the application process over and over. When the house was sold I had filed bankruptcy that morning which should've stopped the sale. At the time I had 2 mortgages with Wells Fargo. I lost my house in XX/XX/XXXX. I became homeless with a XXXX old son. I went through XXXX  XXXX. I had a house for my parents with a loan with Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX Maryland, they lowered the interest rate on that house without my knowledge but would modify the loan I had on my primary home. It was also stated that they sold my home to a sister company of theirs. I have since seen the lawsuits against wells fargo. There were a couple times that I received about {$3000.00} check due to some type of fees, but they never modified my loan. They acknowledged the bankruptcy for the 2nd home but not my primary home. They never put a foreclosure on my credit report but they sold my house and never gave me a remodification."
4/13/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,None,"Wells Fargo foreclosed on my home : On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating that I owed Wells Fargo a payment of {$4000.00}. They stated that I had an unpaid payments ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX bankruptcy of {$250000.00}. Total owed {$260000.00} I then received a notice from them on XX/XX/XXXX : Notice of short sale approval for loan XXXX. Two months later, XX/XX/XXXX, my home was sold out from under me for {$740000.00}! After hearing about the CFPB settlement with Wells Fargo in XXXX of XXXX, I wrote a letter through a lawyer friend to Wells Fargo about losing my home and my place of earning my living. To date I have received no response from Wells Fargo. I have documents from Wells Fargo to supplement my statements. 
It is my belief that Wells Fargo purchased my mortgage sometime after I filed for bankruptcy in XXXX the reason was settling my divorce. Then taking out a second mortgage to pay off a ( {$120000.00} ) loan on the original mortgage to a relative and monthly payments for my wife to resettle in her own apartment. I believe that Wells Fargo sold my home illegally and rightfully owes me money! Wells Fargo Mortgage for loan XXXX made a huge profit by selling my home and place of business! I had to move and completely restart my business! The most my mortgage should have amounted to is about {$400000.00}. I believe that Wells Fargo owes me at least {$300000.00} In XXXX i went through a bankruptcy process. Wells Fargo purchased my mortgage from a company named XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX at the time my mortgage was {$220000.00} and sometime around that time I added {$100000.00} to the mortgage because i had to pay back a relative that loaned us money. I also had to pay my wife during the divorce process. The documents that I submitted from wells Fargo said they were going to help me by doing a short sale on my house ( XXXX XXXX ). They said at that time I owed over {$600000.00}. A month later they sent me a letter saying they already arranged a short sale as a favor to me saying they were selling the house. In that letter it said they were selling the house for XXXX and also they said they already had purchasers for the house. That letter was written by XXXX XXXX and her title was home preservation specialist. The letter had a phone number for her I tried calling and I could not reach her. After i made a complaint with the cfpb I called wells Fargo mortgage because i never heard anything back from them. I was transferred to a person at wells Fargo executive office ( XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX and I went through the process and he said it takes 10 business days for them to process and he said I have established a case number ( XXXX ) for your complaint with wells Fargo and that a case worker would be assigned."
4/13/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,I had an account with Wells Fargo that got closed without my knowledge or approval. When I contacted Wells Fargo they offered no explanation as to why. My account was in good standing and not overdrawn. They were no help at all.
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I made a mobile deposit with two payroll checks and one of them cleared, but the other one didnt I called them and they told me that there was an issue with the check and had me call my employer which told me that the check had cleared their bank and that its Wells Fargo that is delaying my deposit. I have called them several times and they told me they cant release the funds until next week and I just have to wait, this has been an ongoing issue with Wells Fargo for me"
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"On XX/XX/2023 I used a Wells Fargo ATM and made a deposit of {$2100.00} bringing my account balance to {$2500.00}. I received a receipt and what I assumed was my debit card and placed it in my wallet. 

On XX/XX/2023 I called the bank to check the balance on my card and realized that I had a negative balance of {$640.00} on my account. Soon after, I looked in my wallet and realized that the debit card that was returned to me by the Wells Fargo ATM on XX/XX/2023 was not my card, nor did it have my name or card number on it. 

On XX/XX/2023 I spoke to a Wells Fargo representative and she mentioned that on XX/XX/2023 in a Wells Fargo ATM, four different withdrawals had been made. The first of {$2000.00}, second of {$500.00}, third of {$600.00}, and fourth of {$50.00}. I mentioned that I did not make those withdrawals and that the machine did not give me the correct card back. The representative opened a fraud case regarding this issue and told me to wait 10 business days for the investigation. 

On XX/XX/2023 I logged in to my email and there I realized that seven other attempts were made on XX/XX/XXXX in other Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I called the bank to give them this information and there a representative mentioned that they had already done a less than 24 hour investigation and they are now closing the case. They mentioned that I must have taken out the money myself and that now on the other hand, owe them {$640.00}. They also told me to just throw away the card that was given to me by their ATM. 

Aside from speaking to the bank, both on the phone and in person on XX/XX/2023 I also went to the police station and made a police report regarding this issue. There the police officer kept the card that I received from the Wells Fargo ATM as evidence and helped me document everything mentioned above. I handed to him a copy of all my recent transactions as evidence as well. 


Wells Fargo does not want to help me, they closed the case and can not explain to me how my money was taken from my account or why their ATM gave me a card that was not mine. I believe a proper investigation has not been made to see if the machine was tampered with in order for me to receive a card that was not mine. Or a proper investigation has not been made in order to see who is the person who took out the money from my account. 

Please help me, I am now retired and that was all the money I had. My retirement check will be coming in soon and it will soon go to pay for the money that was stolen from me and the overdraft fees that Wells Fargo is now charging me as well. 

I needed the money I deposited to pay for my insurance and tax payment and now those charges have been declined by Wells Fargo and now I also have to pay interest with them as well."
4/13/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"Wells Fargo continues to hold me accountable for two fraudulent charges that were made to my account in XX/XX/2022. I have submitted sufficient evidence, including medical records that indicate I have serious eye issues that prevent me from driving. The charges were made in XXXX IL and there is no way I could drive there. The charges were XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo is claim that they are not accusing me of making the fraudulent charges or filing a false police report so I don't understand their rationale for stating the charges are valid. It is irrational for Wells Fargo to say they are not accusing me of the 2 facts above and yet state that the charges are valid. It is also highly unethical and I will refuse to pay for the charges."
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Incorrectly charged overdraft fees on debit and ATM withdrawals,"
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Spouse and I both work for XXXX XXXX XXXX. We both have direct deposit established to separate checking accounts with Wells Fargo. XX/XX/2023, Pay day for us, BOTH deposit were missing. We obtained the transaction ID from our payroll to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo would not allow credits or any solution except to wait. No explanation, no eta. Our deposits were frozen for 3 days. 
This happened to many getting paid by XXXX XXXX XXXX to Wells Fargo accounts."
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"I went into the Wells Fargo on today on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Texas on today. I told the teller that I wanted to close my account. I had {$23.00} and some change in the account. She gave me the money and told me to call the 1800 # to close the account. I told her that the 1800 # told me to come into the branch and close the account. She told me to come back the next day to close my account because the banker would have to close the account and he was with a client.

I asked for the Manager. The Manager comes to close the account, but then she tells me that I would have to wait until tomorrow because the teller gave me all of my money out of the account. She wanted me to sign a form acknowledging that she did not close the account because of the pending transaction. I told her that I would be charged a fee on tomorrow because the account did not have any money in it. She told me that the account would automatically close when no money was in the account. She refused to close my account the correct way."
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,"I have been complaining to wells fargo since XX/XX/2022 that my money that is being deposited is disappearing Quickly covering overdraft fees. That should not exist because they are posting my deposits late. I called on the monthly basis since XXXX complaining that they even posted a XXXX deposit late Which should have been instant. I explained to them the text message I received says I have a certain available balance. But the website shows my deposits are pending.. And accounts that are ready for withdrawal. Are being paid With a negative balance because they are not posting my deposits on time. There were times that deposits were not posted until two business days later. Around late XXXX or XXXX a case manager was assigned to me while she reviewed my concerns. She came back telling me that I need to manage my money better. There were times that {$300.00} a month was going towards overdraft charges throughout the year. I did not realize this until XXXX that this was going on. 
I felt that wells fargo has been getting away with this because their website does not show Available balances accurately by each transaction. There was one time a representative told me by phone. I had a certain balance that was higher than what it said on the line of the statement. When I asked him to repeat what he said And explain the difference in what he sees on his in versus what i'm looking at all my all my statement He instantly choked up and just started to say things Based on what I was saying and not from His computer screen. I honestly felt I was not getting the help I deserved And he was just covering up the mistake."
4/13/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"Since XXXX, I have been a customer with Wells Fargo Bank, I have had millions of dollars deposited into my account with this bank ( this bank has had several names ). For over 20 years, my Employer deposited my payroll, IRA and other funds into this account. I said all that to inform you that I have been a loyal customer. In the past few years, I have attempted to secure a loan from a place that has proof that I have consistent finances deposited into their Bank. Each time, in the past, they informed me that my credit score was not acceptable for this loan. Recently, I needed a loan to assist with doing some work to my new home purchase. Again, I attempted to secure a loan from my bank that has proof that I have funds to repay any loan and at this time my credit score was above XXXX. In typical Wells Fargo fashion, I was denied!!! 

To my dismay, I was denied again. I made a complaint. I felt that there is no reason that I should have been denied for this loan. I strongly believe it was due to my XXXX background. The denial letter had XXXX concern as to why they denied me. I formed a complaint. Upon speaking to XXXX ( the Wells Fargo staff that addressed my complaint ) he advised that at XXXX point I had a mark on my credit for a civil judgement. I informed XXXX that the judgment had been resolved/paid. I further informed him that how was it that a Bank I have had a 25 year relationship with deny me for a personal loan of an amount that was no where near the amount I had been recently approved for to purchase my home. I purchased my home for {$440000.00} and had no issues being approved. I was approved for a {$6000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card XXXX I had no issues being approved. XXXX continued to say that their system is different, and they have a computer system that uses some formula as to whether or not one may be approved. I have not qualified for any loan at any time with this Bank... I have good credit and I receive a good pension and it is deposited monthly. This loand denial is unacceptable for a company that has a long standing history of discrimination. Wells Fargo mission says "" customers can be better served when they have a relationship with a trusted provider and one that can serve their full range of financial needs. '' Wells Fargo has never been able to help me meet my financial needs and I have XXXX trust in this company. I am XXXX and I really could have used this loan at this time in my life. My XXXX passed away in XXXX. He assisted me alot financially. I was so optimistic that for once Wells Fargo would respect me as a long standing customer with a loan amount that was no where near the amount I was easily approved for to purchase my home. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, CFPB ordered Wells Fargo to pay {$3.00} XXXX for "" illegal activity, '' including unjust foreclosures and vehicle repossessions. This widespread mismanagement over multiple years harmed over XXXX XXXX consumer accounts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wells Fargo 's illegal activity included repeatedly misapplying loan payments, wrongfully foreclosing on homes etc. So with this history in play, am I to believe that this company is being fair in my loan decision? 

Again, any intelligent person can understand that a mortgage company would not take a chance lending a half of XXXX dollars to one who does possess good credit, stable funds and a good history of repaying loans or credit cards. I find it unfathomable that Wells Fargo system is so stringent that I cant qualify for {$50000.00} but yet my mortgage approved me 5 months ago for {$440000.00}. My case is a simple case of "" predatory lending. '' I'm saddened to say that nothing has changed since CFPB investigated Wells Fargo in XXXX. In XXXX, they are still taking advantage of customers."
4/13/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Funds were deposited by SSA on XX/XX/23 ( and ongoing months, twice a month ) and received. Then bank began stating that I had overdrafts even though this did not happen. They withdrew my {$910.00} and only returned {$860.00} of the funds. On XX/XX/23 I paid a bill for {$50.00} and it was authorized on XX/XX/23. The bank then stated on XX/XX/23 that the bill was paid and but {$54.00} was taken from my account. 

Then, when I made a claim on the {$910.00} with the bank ( customer service in the XXXX answered ) I was told that I had withdrawn {$260.00} and {$640.00}, but I had not done this. I stated a claim to a different customer service representative and he said he would put the claim through for me. Then, the money was returned to my bank account ( {$860.00}, not the full {$910.00} ) and that he was going to close the claim now. I still have not received the full amount back in my account.

4/13/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"I am writing to file a complaint against Wells Fargo for denying my loan application despite having been a loyal customer of the bank for eight years. I applied for a loan to consolidate my credit card debt and help me get through a job transition, but my application was denied because my debt-to-income ratio was considered too high. 

I have a credit score of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX which is not poor, and my main source of debt is my student loans amounting to {$60000.00}. However, I am party to a class action lawsuit that resulted in the full discharge of my student loan debt. Although the process has not yet been completed, Wells Fargo did not consider this information in my loan application, stating that they would only consider current information on my credit report. This is unfair and unjust. 

The denial of my loan application has put me in a very difficult financial situation as I will not be able to pay my bills. Furthermore, this decision will have a negative impact on my credit score. Making it even harder to find a loan and preventing me from having the capital I need to start making more income. 

I believe that Wells Fargo 's actions are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires lenders to provide accurate and fair credit reports, and investigate and correct any errors on credit reports. In my case, Wells Fargo 's failure to consider my impending student loan discharge is a clear violation of this act. Wells had approved me 2 months prior when I checked my rate i did not proceed because inwas just exploring my options at the time as ineas anticipating the transition. nothing changed between the first and second application. I even went to the bank and tried to get a loan with the representative, bringing the necessary evidence to demonstrate the student loan debt would be clear. I also have a recorded call with a representative who told me the only information Wells Fargo considers is what is currently showing on my credit report. I was supposed to get a call back and never did. 

Moreover, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits lenders from discriminating based on race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. I have not experienced discrimination based on any of these factors, but the failure of Wells Fargo to consider my impending student loan discharge could be interpreted as a form of discrimination against my financial status. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against Wells Fargo. I believe that I deserve fair treatment and the opportunity to improve my financial situation without any discrimination. I now don't even know what I am going to do because i am a single parent. I recieve no child supoort and i have no family or friends I can go-to for money. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, [ Your Name ]"

On XX/XX/, I initiated a transfer of {$5000.00} from my checking account into my wife 's Wells Fargo Checking account. On the same day, my wife closed her Wells Fargo Checking account, and was issued a check for those funds at a bank branch. That check did NOT include the $ XXXX from the transfer I initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the transfer was processed by my bank and the $ XXXX was deducted from my account. If we had not been paying close attention and caught this on our own, Wells Fargo would have kept that money, rather than issuing a refund or cancellation of the $ XXXX transfer, which is what they should have done. The transaction could not be completed because the XXXX  account was closed, so the transaction should have never went through. But the transaction did complete and the $ XXXX disappeared, as far as we're concerned. My wife had to reach out to Wells Fargo customer service to try to resolve this issue -- Wells Fargo claims they are "" investigating '' but we haven't received a resolution. I'm raising this complaint because I worry that other Wells Fargo customers may experience similar situations where transferred funds disappear, or don't go where they are supposed to.

After two years they reached out asking if we were able to make payments again to which I said yes. It was then that they suggested that I apply for loan modification as it could put me in a better position with monthly payments and get me back on track. I agreed and begin the application process with them. After four different attempts with them, they kept restarting the process because they would lose documents and say that they didnt have enough information and make me start the process over again. This went on for about a year and Ive still been trying to get into a loan modification, and now they are telling me that I am denied because my loan is too far in default that the payments would be too high. The only reason that the payments would be too high is because theyve had me trapped in this loan modification application process for a year while offering me no other alternative to resolve the matter. Now they are telling me my only option is a short sale when from the beginning I was never trying to go that route. I was trying to work this out with them for over a year and have hundreds of documented conversations and emails with them about this. They are now telling me I either need to pay {$71000.00} or short sale my home. None of those are options I wanted or planned for or have been working with them diligently for a year.

4/14/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"RE : Fraudulent XXXXWells Fargo Chargeback Claim against my account My ex claimed that the money he sent me through XXXX through his Wells Fargo account was fraud. However, he sent me the money himself and it was not fraud. He fraudulently filed a chargeback claim. Please read below : My ex XXXX XXXX has lived with me in my home from XXXX XXXX. He worked and paid the bills and I was a homemaker from XXXX XXXX. He would send me his paycheck through XXXX  or direct deposit or give me cash. He has always had money put in my bank account throughout the time we have lived together since XXXX. 

He was hired on permanently at his job at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. ( from XXXX XXXX XXXX he was working for them through a temp job agency named XXXX ). XXXX XXXX required him to have his own bank account to get direct deposit. So he went and opened his own Wells Fargo account on XX/XX/XXXX. I even went with him to the bank the first time he tried to open the account but we had to go a second time and that time he went alone. Since all the bills in our home were in my name he would send or give me the money and I would pay the bills. 

He sent a few XXXX  transfers to me from his wells fargo account to my wells fargo account. A few times I sent him money as well. From XXXX XXXX XXXX He would have his temp agency  deposit his paychecks in my account and you can see those deposits weekly from XXXX XXXX. After he was hired on to his job from the temp agency XXXX to the company payroll XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX he would get a papercheck while the direct deposit was getting set up and he would either cash it and give me cash or deposit it with mobile deposit or in person then transfer me the money using XXXX. We both transferred money to each other by XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Due to escalating XXXX from him I left the relationship XX/XX/XXXX, he moved out of my home on XX/XX/XXXX. I applied for a protective order on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX ( Initial protective order hearing was XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Immediately after that hearing I got the notification that my bank account was overdrawn by over {$1200.00}. I logged in and saw that Wells Fargo took {$1100.00} from my account and gave back to him stating that he reported the transfers from XX/XX/XXXX as unauthorized and as fraud. When I called Wells Fargo they told me that the investigator investigated his claim and decided it was fraud. However, I was never contacted or asked about the transfers. If the investigator would have looked at both of our accounts they would have seen that we both had the same address and sent money back and forth to each other. 

How is it ethical or okay for them to reverse the transfer when it is not fraud he very much intended to send me the money. I have text messages and witnesses that can testify to the fact we were living together and he was paying the bills and I was the homemaker. He very much intended to send me the money. 

I do not believe that Wells Fargo completed a thorough and accurate investigation and believe they stole my money. Not only did they take the {$1100.00} from my account but I only had around {$1000.00} in my account so it made my account go overdrawn and several of the transactions from that weekend that posted on XX/XX/XXXX were sent back and I am sure I will have to pay returned payment fees from those merchants. My account continues to be overdrawn and the current balance is negative $ XXXX. If you look at the attached bank statement you will see where XXXX sent me money and also where I sent him money back in XX/XX/XXXX. If his transfers to me is fraud why is my transfers to him not fraud? I have text messages where we are discussing him sending me the money. You will see cash deposits in my account from XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$730.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$380.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$590.00} and XXXX for {$960.00} all of these were from him getting cash from his paychecks and giving me cash. 




I have tried to resolve this issue with Wells Fargo several times. It appears they are not concerned at all with this issue as I have not received not even one phone call back as promised several times. 





On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo to complain about the reversal stating it was authorized and legitimate and not fraud. I was told a complaint was submitted on my behalf regarding the XXXX transfer reversal. 

I called Wells Fargo back XX/XX/XXXX to verify that a claim was opened and was told there was not a claim opened. I spoke to XXXX, a senior escalation agent with the Assist team. He stated that he would send the information to the investigator to have them reconsider the reversal and that i should hear back from the investigator by Thursday XX/XX/XXXX. He would not give me the investigators name or contact information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo back and stated that I never heard back from the investigator and requested to speak to a supervisor. The senior escalation agent with the Assist team told me that she would have a supervisor call me back within 48 hours as well would also send my complaint to the executive office and someone from that office would contact me within 10 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that the Wells Fargo executive team would contact me within 10 business days to discuss complaint or if they needed to do more research would let me know if needed more time. 

I called on XX/XX/XXXX to verify that my complaint was sent to the executive team and to see if I could speak to the investigator before they made their determination. The lady said that someone named XXXX would be contacting me within the 10 business day timeframe. 




I did not hear back from wells fargo executive department within 10 days. I emailed them they emailed me a response back on XX/XX/XXXX stating that they do need additional time to research. I received a call from XXXX XXXX with the executive team and she apologized for the delays and she got the story from me again and then said she would investigate and get back to me. I explained to her that my ex XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  if Wells Fargo takes the XXXX from his account and returns to me that it will result in him trying to harm me in some way either trying to make me lose my job, my son ( he called XXXX on me as well since I have left the XXXX relationship and that case was closed within 2 weeks as they saw it was a frivolous report as well ). I asked XXXX if she can tell me if the money would come from him or from an insurance claim because if it is coming from him then I dont feel safe and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$1100.00} she told me there is no way for her to know and there is no way for her to speak to the next level of people that would be in charge of the claim and there is no way for me to speak to them there is no way for them to call me. I asked can you notate that if the claim is coming from insurance i want to proceed but coming from him then i dont want to proceed due to safety. She said again there is no way for her to insure that happens. i asked for her supervisors information she said there is noone above her that i can speak to. She said she asked her coworkers and they all said the same thing. I do not believe Wells Fargo is honest truthful or ethical. I would like for Wells Fargo to investigate the claim and see that these claims were not fraud and return my money to me in the full amount of {$1100.00} plus any returned fees that have been charged to my account or to me due to them taking the {$1100.00} in error. HOWEVER, due to my ex being XXXX I know if he wakes up and this money is gone from his account that he will come after me XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to make this right. This was a result of a poorly executed or non existent research/investigation of his fraudulent chargeback claim of the money he knowingly sent me. Now my account is overdrawn {$260.00} and I attempted to close it but they wont close it until I pay that amount which I will BUT it would not be overdrawn if Wells Fargo had done a proper investigation into his fraud claim. If they had denied his fraud claim he would have moved on and there wouldnt be an issue today. I no longer trust any P2P system or really any bank. One day my money was there one day it was gone. 
I have attached my XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX bank statements along with the emails I received from Wells Fargo regarding this matter for your reference. XXXX and XXXX bank statements show XXXXXXXX XXXX  direct deposits into my account as he authorized his employer to do. We also had the same addresses on our wells fargos accounts during the time he sent me the money. All of these facts should have been used by the investigator to deny his claim of fraud.

I shouldn't have to go to the FBI and go down a rabbit hole with them that won't yield any result, you know it as well as I do. I've filed with FTC, CFPB, local law, local news outlets and attorney general. at what point will this Bank make right what is clearly its fault and for once do what's right and take care of a customer who has been faithful for 20 years. I will not let this go and I will drag it out until such time as it is made right by wellsfargo."
4/14/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Asking CFPB for there help, Wells Fargo answer is not Accurate, Factual and Disingenuous. 

I previously filed a complaint on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint ID # XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX Complaint ID # XXXX but complaint gets closed out without me having a chance to respond and getting an answer back from Wells Fargo. 

This current complaint is in response to XXXX XXXX Answer to my complaint # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I feel Wells Fargo errored in the denial of my Modification Per the SEC ; A quarterly filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission in XX/XX/XXXX revealed that Wells Fargo made an error in denying mortgage modifications to hundreds of borrowers. The securities filing says that Wells Fargo discovered a calculation error in its automated software for calculating whether a borrower should be offered more favorable loan terms in lieu of foreclosure. Wells Fargo says the error affected XXXX homes that were in the foreclosure process between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. And as stated in above SEC complaint and numerous Law Suits against Wells Fargo for Denying Mortgage Modification due to a "" Software Glitch ''. 

In Wells Fargo response they stated ; We wanted to speak with you directly but were unable to connect with you at the phone number ( s ) provided to us. 

I received a phone call From Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX at XXXX saying they are working on my concerns and need a little more time and will have an answer by XX/XX/XXXX, if you have any further question give me a call back at XXXX. 

At No Time did XXXX XXXX state he wanted to speak with you ( me ) directly. 
I returned XXXX XXXX call the same day on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX but had to leave a message on his voice mail. I told him I received his call and I explained I was no longer seeking one part of my claim on # 2 Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ). In my research WF insurance Ins Fee was listed as Hazard Ins, as I looked into this, I established that the Hazzard Ins is actually Home Owners Ins. My Insurance Carrier who is the Company Insuring my property refers to it as Property Insurance due to the difference in terminology caused the confusion. 

After my Return Call to XXXX, he never called me back with further question, the next call I received was XX/XX/XXXX saying they reached a resolution to my complaint. How are they stating We wanted to speak with you directly but were unable to connect with you at the phone number ( s ) provided to us when they never said they wanted to speak to me directly and also that I never received a return call to the message I left XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I also received two letters from Wells Fargo Dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and in Both letters never stated they wanted to speak to me directly. 

Now to the beginning of Wells Fargos answer, as I said I was dropping # 2 Wells Fargo unauthorized charges ( fees ) in that I determined the issue was in the terminology used to describe the Insurance fee. My Ins Company refers to it a Property Ins but Wells Fargo referred to it as Hazzard Ins. 

Next, Wells Fargo answer states HAMP denial was due to your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income, I ask Wells Fargo to produce the Documents they used to Determine this? 

I entered in the CPLR 3408, Court held a mandatory settlement conference in XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo offered a Proposed Modification with a mortgage term of 40 years, a principal and interest of {$1300.00} with property taxes of {$640.00} and Hazzard Ins of {$130.00} for a total of {$2100.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a yearly income as of XX/XX/XXXX of more than {$80000.00} or a monthly income {$8800.00}. Here Wells Fargo did not negotiate a modification in Good Faith How is a proposed modify monthly mortgage of {$2100.00} more than the HAMP 42 % guidelines on a monthly income of {$8800.00}? At that time, when I more than proved that I qualify for the HAMP modification, Wells Fargo came back and stated the investor does not participate in the program Next in Wells Fargos answer they state the investor of your loan did not participate in HAMP. If this was the case, why did Wells Fargo participate in prolong Modification Negotiations of over 1 year? 

This is another part of Wells Fargo did not negotiate a modification in Good Faith ( part 2 ) Why did Wells Fargo give me a Proposed Modification with a term of 40 years, with monthly payments of {$2100.00} reduced from my original mortgage payment of {$3500.00}? All Wells Fargo did by Falsely Negotiate a Modification under CPLR3408 for over 1 year is rack up more mortgage payments, interest, penalties and fees making it harder for me to get a loan modification by other means. Also, by Wells Fargo Falsely Negotiating a modification for over 1 year it cost me Legal Fees during the ongoing negotiations. 

Even though Wells Fargo denied my modification due to the investor of your loan did not participate in HAMP we continued to negotiate a modification through Wells Fargo who did participate in HAMP. In XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargos Attorney who Wells Fargo referred to as Mediation Counsel in review of all the documents, asked them to reconsider their HAMP Denial. Why would Wells Fargo own Mediation Counsel ask Wells Fargo to reconsider? Because he saw through the documents submitted including Wells Fargos Proposed Modification that I qualified under the HAMP guidelines.

Again, Im asking Wells Fargo to produce the papers that they used here to determine that I did not qualify under the HAMP 42 % guidelines.

Im Aware the SLS is the servicer of the Loan since XXXX but the period of time Im referring to is the CPLR 3408 Court held a mandatory settlement conference starting in XX/XX/XXXX and going into early XXXX. 

Conclusion : 1 ) CPLR 3408, Court held a mandatory settlement conference in which Wells Fargo did not act in good faith in negotiations and improperly denied me a mortgage loan modification. Due to an error by Wells Fargos Software Glitch they in error denied me a mortgage modification as argued by my attorney and as by Wells Fargos own Attorney Mediation Counsel asking XXXX and Wells Fargo to reconsider their denials.

2 ) Wells Fargos answer is not accurate and disingenuous and Im asking CFPB help to look into my claim.

If I was given correct information I could have then filed in the time permitted. 
After I filed my complaint concerning the issue Well Fargo XXXX, returned a phone call to me stating he will assist me with my issue, he claimed to look in to it, days past on the XXXX day of XXXX I received a call from XXXX again telling me my claim was denied due to me approving the transactions, even though he was aware of me doing so ( I wasn't claiming it was fraudulent, I was claiming the service was unsatisfactory and not producing satisfying results, failed to achieve results that were agreed upon. 
The following day I call back and I speak with an associate XXXX, I asked him why was my case denied to get the exact words, he then tells me there isn't any record of a case being opened or reopened and even if it was there isn't anything they can do, I replied with well if that is true why would XXXX say he would open a case again if he wasn't. Once again I was being lied to? 
The day after that I call again I spoke with XXXX, tells me the same thing I gave the case # the claim # came up with nothing and says there is no record of anybody even calling me. 
So they just say they are doing an investigation and not. If they did an investigation they would see that the outcome of the transaction was not in my favor and paying {$9000.00} for claiming to provide service is stealing to me. All they would have to do is see pictures. 
And if I were given correct information in the first place I would have put in the claim in the time permitted to do so. 
I am very disappointed in the actions that they have taken or not taken, I had trusted them with my money my whole life being and I was treated like I was nothing"

4/15/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was subjected to the worst credit fraud I have experienced. A criminal portraying XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  revealed ALL my credit cards and personal information. But then, when he tells me that after paying off 3 credit cards for over {$4000.00} then he tells me that the credit cards will no longer be active because when credit cards have a XXXX balance, they'll automatically close. 

This is what clued me that he was a criminal and had all my credit card and personal information. He was calling me from a phone number I called and it's an inactive XXXX phone number, the answer we get when we dial : XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I confronted him this phony criminal so-called XXXX XXXX XXXX he said that it was for security reason. By this time, I leery and realized he was a criminal and I hung up. Indeed, the following charges are from foreign countries. This when Wells Fargo called me and was with them over 3 hours, yesterday. 

Then yesterday he's charging my Wells Fargo Visa for over {$3000.00} Credit card ending XXXX with names of foreign firms : on XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX. Amount {$1000.00} from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Amount {$500.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount {$490.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. There's another charge from my checking account but Wells Fargo deleted. 

Then Wells Fargo contacts from number XXXX XXXX XXXX indicating it's the WF Credit Card Fraud Dept. I was with a WF Rep yesterday for over XXXX hours. Then Wells Fargo tells me to mail a check for the entire checking account to XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, KS. WF said that I must mail my check to the indicated firm today by XXXX. Since, it didn't make sense I called WF today to verify that I was to send my money to the indicated firm overnight and they were going to call me for a tracking number. But Wells Fargo the indicated department tells me not to mail it. That it not how Wells Fargo deals with closing and account and opening a new one, I was told. 

But today when I called to get more information there was a very abusive representative. When she sent me a code, I tried to verify the number she texted me from and just about I was going to read the 6-digit code she tells me that I failed to identify myself and I'm now restricted from accessing my accounts, that I must wait 24 hours or go into the branch that it's 40 miles away. So now I have been subjected to fraud then on top of fraud Wells Fargo also subjects me to fraud. 

As if it wasn't bad enough now, I can't even access my account. It's intolerable that Wells Fargo, instead of helping me, subjects me to fraud, it's more than I can take. I pray to God that Wells Fargo comes to its "" senses. I have reported the credit card scammer to the FTC, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and to Wells Fargo ; however, two wrongs don't make a right. May God help us. Since, Wells Fargo instead of helping it made things worse. In addition, I had to reset all my 3 emails passwords because all of my passwords did not work. I still can't get to all my email accounts!"
4/15/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"This is my second time filing the complaint against Wells Fargo Mortgage Company because this company is the one got us in trouble, and refusing to communicate with us for more than two years.

This is what happened : During pandemic, the Wells Fargo Mortgage company reached out and offered me mortgage assistance with forbearance for a couple of months. 

By the end of the forbearance, they told me to pay all of the amount together for the months that I was putting on forbearance. 

If they had explained to me that was going to happened, I would never taken their forbearance program. 

Then they default my loan and threaten me with foreclosure process on my property. 

The information on their website is never the same with what they said or display on the automatic machines. 

They froze my account and I couldn't continue to pay for my mortgage even though I was able to pay monthly payments. 

Wells Fargo Mortgage never explains anything going on with my property. I was passed around more than twenty two customers during the period of two years, and no one could answer anything.

Superior Court of XXXX XXXX was the one told me that there is fraud activity on my mortgage loan, and suggested me to get a lawyer. 

They sent out letters and letters to the house, but when we called, they never have answers for our questions, including upper management team. 

I bought my house in 2012, with the kids ' dad I was married to him until before pandemic took place. 

I was the one paying for the mortgage since 2012, but Wells Fargo did not care who was paying as long as someone was paying. 

Wells Fargo got me into this mess with their forbearance program because I was able to pay monthly until they put me into their assistant program. 

I did not needed their help, and I still do not want their help, but they are dishonest people that want to take away a house that my ex- husband and I bought for our children. 

About this complaint is : I bought my house for around {$450000.00} in 2012. We have been paying consistently until pandemic took placed, where Wells Fargo came to us with forbearance program. 

Wells Fargo Mortgage did not help anything with the mortgage loan, and stopped the access to make payment on the loan. I couldn't log on to the website, and the checks were returned. 
Now my family and I want to save our property from Wells Fargo, and asked for the pay off amount, no one wanted to answer me. 

when I called the last time to XXXX XXXX ( Executive Office Case Specialist ) for pay off amount to save my house, she told me she did not want to talk to me because I was not on the title. I don't understand why she refused to tell me the pay off amount to save my own home. If I want to help pay off someone's loan ( for parents, or my kids, or my best friend ), why should it matter that my name is on the tile of the loan? Now, as you requested, I am on the title of the loan legally. I have told you it was in the process, and you have not bothered to talk to me about the loan. 

My ex- husband gave authorized solely to me on the title as of today, and my documents are on the way to Wells Fargo as well, so that they can no longer Not answer my questions ( what I hope, but I know they will be the same ). 

I want Well Fargo Mortgage to answer me why I have to pay around {$460000.00} for my house when I bought my house for around {$450000.00} in 2012. The amount on the website says my pay off amount is around {$300000.00}. When my lawyer asked for the amount in document of pay off amount on XX/XX/XXXX, is far more than what I have purchased in 2012. 

I know why. You added all these fees when you put a stop on my loan account and now is exceeded to {$460000.00}. You put me into a situation that I have no way out. 

How is that possible? We were paying for almost 10 years on our home consistently. All those years that we made payments were never put into our loan then? 

I am doing this complaint for my XXXX kids. This is their childhood home, and my daughter has two more years to graduate from high school, and now I do know what I have to tell her about her living situations because of Wells Fargo Mortgage Company. 

I know they never answer our questions or have any solution for their customer. 
I have XXXX trust in them, and zero believe in them. For them to come and shake our family like this is inhuman. This house is my kids ' heart, and future, and created with love, blood and sweat. 

I just want to pay what I own ( the actual honest amount, not they added up all extra fees ), and I do not want to deal with them ever. 

And I know I am not the only victim, and they have not stopped what they have been doing for years on hard working parents like me and many others. 

This has to stop.

- On XX/XX/2023, I initiated the {$6500.00} rent payment on the XXXX XXXX. XXXX withdrew via ACH, on XX/XX/2023, from my XXXX bank account, the amount in full. 

- On XX/XX/2023, XXXX charged my XXXX credit card, without my consent and authorization, and fraudulently, for {$6500.00}. I noticed the charge a few days thereafter, reached out to customer service and they agreed to remove the charge. Had I not noticed the charge, XXXX would have enriched itself fraudulently by double charging me for rent. 

- The additional, fraudulent charge of {$6500.00} on my credit card statement caused a precipitous decline in my credit score, for overusage of credit lines ( the document attached shows my credit score being reduced by over XXXX points, and my credit usage at 333 % due to this charge ). Since this charge is fraudulent, and not my responsibility, I demand that XXXX rectify the disastrous effects this has placed to my credit score, my ability to secure credit, and the work it will require to rebuild my credit to satisfactory levels. 

- On XX/XX/2023, I initiated a the same {$6500.00} rent payment on the XXXX XXXX. XXXX withdrew via XXXX, on XX/XX/2023, from my XXXX XXXX account, the amount in full. 

- Unbelievably, on XX/XX/2023, XXXX charged my XXXX credit card again, without my consent and authorization, and fraudulently, for {$6500.00}. I am in the process of getting this charged removed. 


It is clear, based on two months of evidence, that XXXX operates a fraudulent "" rent payment '' scheme and the CFPB should intervene, stop the program, and ensure that every person who used it has not been double charged.

4/15/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : Wells Fargo has been mismanaging my mortgage for the past year and a half. On top of this, they have assessed additional fees and interests without any notifications or approval on my end. These faulty errors are causing me a loss in the excess of {$50000.00}. I am surprised that they have sent letters about escrow shortages, even though I have constantly been consistent. I am also on a fixed rate mortgage, therefore the interest should not be fluctuating as it has. My bill from when my mortgage started to how it is will serve proof as to how my mortgage is being handled. I am saddened that XXXX XXXX  gave them my account and I could not choose what lender bought it, otherwise, I would not be having to face the mismanaging. I work too hard to be cheated. 

Not to mention, much of my states assistance funds I received during XXXX in XXXX were not been allocated and disbursed correctly. Rather than correct these issues as well, all of the agents did not understand any of what was going on with my account. In an effort to maintain my mortgage they forced me to pay an escrow shortage over the phone and they had me disclose my routing and account number over the phone. They stated that it was necessary or I would be at risk of foreclosing. Something illegal seems to be going on. Whether it is an automated issue that is going on or intentional harm, I ask that these damages be recompensed by applying these considerations back into my mortgage account.

And thats not the bad part, they moved the money i transferred out of my account completely, they didn't even refund to my checking nor savings.

Fast forward to XXXX and unexpectedly and due to natural causes my husband passed away. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  My life quickly changed and I could not afford our home mortgage. I wanted to keep our house for my children and I so I called Wells Fargo requesting a loan modification due to my change in monthly income. My monthly income was now less anywhere from {$3500.00} - {$6000.00} ( straight pay and overtime ) a month since my husband was gone. It was a very scary feeling and I had looked to Wells Fargo to be sympathetic to what had just happened to my family but they were not and denied me the modification saying we had already modified our loan. I explained again why I was asking for a new modification but they told me it didnt matter and denied me. My home was foreclosed on via a judicial foreclosure and so Wells Fargo took my home. It is my understanding a judicial foreclosure is very expensive and all attorney fees are paid by the home owner. Because I do not think Wells Fargo should have foreclosed on me and because I never asked for a judicial foreclosure I believe Wells Fargo owes me some type of restitution. They have never contacted me about this class action law suit they lost and Ive been waiting. Now Im reaching out to you to see what can be done. Wells Fargo has kept my home mortgage listed as a debt on my Wells Fargo account since last month. It was only until last month that is showed as a debt I owed. Finally late last month there were some transactions that showed on my account. I did not make any payments to my mortgage nor was I notified or refunded of the amounts. Below are the transactions and the amounts.

I have been an account holder with Wells Fargo since XXXX and since then have held a checking account, car loan and the mortgage. My checking account has been dinged over drafts even when my checking account showed I had money in there. Wells Fargo let me have the money but on the next business day declared I over drafted my account and a {$35.00} charge was listed on my account for most times more then one overdraft fee. My husband and I had a car loan we did end up paying off thru Wells Fargo but Im listing it in case they did something funny with that account and finally my husbands name is no longer listed on the Wells Fargo account and thought wouldnt it be funny if they tried issuing a refund in his name but retracted it because he isnt listed on the account anymore so Im wondering about that too.

4/16/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction problem,None,"To whom this may concern, This letter is being written with disappointment and alarm. I have been managing my business funds with Wells Fargo for many years. I have always trusted its fraud protection claims but, after becoming a victim of fraud, it is clear that these claims are fraudulent themselves. I am appalled at the denial to return my funds to me. 

To explain in more detail : My personal/business cell phone ( XXXX ) was compromised on XX/XX/XXXX by an incoming call- XXXX @ XXXX as indicated in included XXXX call log *Not facilitated by me* *Date call forwarding was set-up* XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX call logs and XXXX assistance note logs proof of account compromise was set-up by criminal under Filer XXXX until new sim card was installed on XX/XX/XXXX, only outgoing calls were able to be completed. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Fraud claim found/initiated with Wells Fargo due to {$25000.00} wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX account . 

XX/XX/XXXX : WF denied claim XX/XX/XXXX : Post WF denial/refusal to return funds, criminal report was ONLY way to proceed and was filed ( XXXX records included- Filer no longer present on records post new sim card, Police video evidence proving phone was compromised and NOT under XXXX XXXX virtual control ). *Date of Police report/video footage was completed post WF denied claim- why date of compromise and date of police report NOT completed same date. 

-Detective XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX police reports notes criminal completed multiple calls with a NonFixedVOIP number indicated on call log as Filer XXXX means that whoever used those phone numbers that contacted you, and forwarded your phone number to the VOIP number did not register any information ( e.g. a hardline phone number, name, address etc. ), and these numbers can be accessed by anyone without knowing who it is. VOIP phone service providers ( basically the internet ) does not collect this information on their users when it is a Non-Fixed number. 

The criminal REMOTELY initiated a wire transfer from my phone number however this was NOT from me. This has now been proven in my legal police report documentation ( case # XXXX ) and I have 2 detectives advising me that I should be in no way responsible for what occurred. 

I have re-opened my case with WF Fraud Department multiple times since they continue to deny ensuring my funds since the wire was technically initiated from my phone, ignoring the details of the criminal action involved. Again, it has been legally proven that this was not me initiating it from my phone as it was compromised and remotely initiated. I have also been denied due to WF not ensuring wire transfers which is not in the fine print that I received. This is unacceptable as a member of Wells Fargo both personally and with my business, and I refuse to accept this determination. 

My patience and composure have become thin and at this time you have lead me to inform ALL my wealthy colleagues, members of my local business networks, The XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX, FBI, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I refuse to stand idle and allow my colleagues to be taken advantage of after years of loyalty to Wells Fargo. To advise young business owners not to make the mistakes that I have I will also be posting on social media with the hashtags that I unfortunately now find easily as there is a community of individuals being duped by the Wells Fargo Fraud Department. Silence is no longer an option.

They ignore on helping me and can't reach the party that was supposed to help me. This problem has been going on too long now and just want to resume my mortgage at a timely matter but there customer service dept at so many level is HORRIBLE PERIOD and also in closing they have been reported to the media on how they treat there customers including us
4/16/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I have waiting to see if Wells Fargo has included me as part of the CFPB as I definitely should be included. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX when I hadn't received anything from them. No one would even attempt to look at my records. I was only given a genetic answer that they are still working on cases and they will be in contact with me. 

In XXXX Wells Fargo refused to consider any type of modification of my loan because they provided me a 3 month modification in XXXX. All payment requirements were met in XXXX and I was making regular monthly mortgage payments until XX/XX/XXXX. 
In XX/XX/XXXX my husband was injured and unable to continue working. He applied for XXXX payments. He finally began receiving monthly payments in XXXX. 
I requested XXXX consideration in XX/XX/XXXX which was denied in XX/XX/XXXX because Wells Fargo decided the 31 % income requirements were met. A second HAMP filed in XX/XX/XXXX was denied in XX/XX/XXXX. 
During this time I worked diligently with a mortgage workout counselor through a local agency and was reassured there would be no problem in qualifying for assistance through Wells Fargo because I met all the requirements. 
I worked closely with Wells Fargo and provided them any and all documents needed and attended and completed credit counseling. Every time I contacted them I was assured they were processing my case. It took nearly 2 YEARS for them to turn around and tell me I didn't meet the requirements because of the 3 month trial modification I completed 5 years previously. I will never understand why they gave me false hope and led my credit counselor and I on for 2 years thinking all was good and my request would be honored. 
I would appreciate a good long look at my case. There is no doubt Wells Fargo mistreated me and I should be included in the CFPB suit if I'm not already."

In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with home preservationist XXXX XXXX stated after provide all the information over the phone stated that I would qualify for the loan modification. She stated she was going to send a package for me to complete with supporting documentation. While waiting for the package to me sent I received Notice of Default and Intent of Foreclosure from American Servicing Company via certified ltr notarized. After receiving the certified letter, I received a package in the mail that had documents to complete to start the modification process. On XX/XX/XXXX, received letter in the mail stating my documents have been received and were being reviewed. In XX/XX/XXXX, received letter of assignment of home preservationist specialist to assist me in my process. Then mid XX/XX/XXXX, ASC affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank had sent certified letter concerning acceleration and foreclosure right to cure. After receiving that notification called to check the status of my modification customer service of ASC stating that no notes concerning modification. Since ASC aka Wells Fargo wouldn't acknowledge the communication about the loan modification I proceed with filing a complaint with West Virginia Attorney General Office against Wells Fargo to prevent the foreclosure. An individual work with my state attorney generals office Consumer Protection & Antitrust Division worked with me to stop Wells Fargo from foreclosing. Wells Fargo. I think that I should have been notified about the class action lawsuit with Wells Fargo because they made the error and my state attorney generals office requested that they correct the foreclosure. Wells Fargo process the correction as a modification but only to there advantage didn't assist me with my hardship only reinstated my loan to satisfy the attorney generals office.

The credit card was current with no late payments. It had a XXXX balance, I have 3 other accounts including a paid in full car loan, another card paid in full. 

Their reason was that 12 years ago I had a late pay. It was not an issue when they issued me the card. Another reason given was that my cash accounts ( checking & saving ) did not have high enough balance. I have over XXXX in savings in other banks.

I also had a payroll check held for no reason and the account put on hold because they said the check was fraud.

I would hate to think that someone at my local branch went into my account but that is very possible. I feel as if there was money stolen out of my account at the time that the XXXX was deposited into my account in 2022. I have made several calls to this location, and even took off of work to sit down with someone to no avail.

On XX/XX/2023 Wells Fargo climed that a check would be sent to me within XXXX days. It is now XX/XX/2023. WELL BEYOND the reasonable amount of time for them to send the check. The check has NOT been received. 

It seems that Wells Fargo is just making false promises in hope that a customer they have stole funds from will just go away. That will not happen. 

I will keep opening complaints with the CFPB, the XXXX the FTC, and the attorney generals office until this is resolved. I am not going to allow some large corporation try take advantage of a because they think they can. You're large corporation money doesn't scare me and I will continue to do this until it is resolved and the company returns the funds they have stole from me. 

I am not contacting another company via a phone number. That is not my responsibility. However, I will take the information that Wells Fargo provided and file all those appropriate claims and complaints with XXXX XXXX XXXX so we can ensure this is properly documented and everyone can be aware of these unethical business practices by these large corporations. 

I'll also start email people that work at the companies as I know XXXX give a ton of email address out there for me to contact. It doesn't seem the customer service want to resolve this issue so I just email individuals from the companies in hopes I can be put in touch with someone that does want to resolve the issue. 

Thanks for understanding.

4/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I own a small business and have a business checking account with Wells Fargo bank. On XX/XX/23 I deposited a check for {$4500.00} and on XX/XX/23 I received an email saying Wells Fargo put a bank hold on the check deposited. We immediately called the payer and he sent us a screen shot of the monies clearing his federal credit union. We then called Wells Fargo and we were told theyre holding it for 10 days due to suspicious activity. Today I spoke with everybody and nobody can tell me why this hood was placed on our account and the money has cleared from the payers account. Wells Fargo keeps giving me their same old tired refrain about suspicious activity which by now we all know thats b.s.! Ive wasted more time on the phone trying to get this money released as we are a small business and need it badly. 
Its so frustrating to talk to Wells Fargo and be passed around from department to department, to be disconnected and have to call back several times only to be told to go to a branch. We went to the branch and they called their back office and told us it would be 10 days for this hold!! As of this writing I still dont know where the suspicious activity is as Wells Fargo already has the money released from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The only one inconvenienced is me, the customer!!"
4/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"on XX/XX/XXXX I mailed a check made payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Collector in the amount of {$3800.00}. When I notice the check had not cleared my account I got worried that my taxes were not going to be paid on time so on XX/XX/XXXX I paid the property taxes online. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my account and saw the check I wrote back on XX/XX/XXXX had cleared my account along with the electronic payment. I sent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Collector an email asking them to please credit my XXXX installment of taxes since I paid twice ( by check and electronically ). I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXr on XX/XX/XXXX and the person I spoke to said the only payment they received was the electronic payment. I said how is that possible, my account shows the check I mailed to you was cashed. He asked me if the back of the check had a stamp with XXXX XXXX XXXX Collector. He said if it did not then fraud had been committed and to contact my bank. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and they filed a fraud claim. They closed out my old account and gave me a new one. On XX/XX/XXXX I walked into the Wells Fargo XXXX and ask what was going on with my fraud case and they said a fraud form had been mailed out to me which I never received. I ended up going into the closest Wells Fargo branch to fill out the fraud form which they needed to contact the Fraud Department for the form. I was told by Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX negotiated the item and on the back of the check was signed by some XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo has told me that XXXX  XXXX XXXX has up to 120 days to reply to my claim. It is now 84 days since I reported the fraud and I still do not have MY money back in my account."
4/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"In XXXX of 2021 I was victim of a zelle scam, more like a robbery. I was at the grocery store and on my phone looking something up when a stranger approached me and asked me a question and before I could respond he quickly snatched my phone out of my hand. The phone was unlocked since I had just been looking something up. I was so shocked and scared I couldnt even speak or act and this person quickly opened my XXXX app and within seconds made a transaction to himself. It so happens that XXXX is directly connected to my Wells Fargo app so it doesnt have the normal safety features that a regular XXXX XXXX has for someone that doesnt have Wells Fargo bank XXXX there is more authentication with a XXXX app because its not directly linked to your banking account on same banking app. When you have the Wells Fargo XXXX if your phone is already unlocked because you are using it, its very easy to open it and use it especially if your face is nearby for XXXX ID. This person was clearly experienced and had done this before. When I noticed what this person had done I reached for the phone and he threw it towards me and ran out of the store. I went to the customer service counter and told them what happened. One of the managers ran out of the store with me to look for him but we couldnt find him. Police case was filed, the grocery store has camera footage where you can clearly see what happened. This has been traumatic and scary and you know what makes it worse? That Wells Fargo Fraud Dept will not give me the {$550.00} the criminal took, no protection from the fraud/robbery at all. I keep appealing the case and they keep telling me I authorized the transaction. Its like if I am speaking a different language when I tell them what happened. How does that sound like I authorized it? I want a bank that stands by my side, clearly not Wells Fargo, closing the account as soon as I have a day off from my work as I am a teacher. 
Wells Fargo has responded to my appeal stating I authorized it. As stated many times this transaction was not done by me or authorized by me. This was a crime, theft, someone stole money from my Wells Fargo account via the app XXXX which is directly linked to my Wells Fargo account. They were able to make the transaction because as stated before the phone was unlocked and this fraud was done right in front of me before I realized what was happening. I had witnesses, the criminal is on camera and there is a police case. But the police does not return the money. The criminal WAS NOT authorized to use my account. The law states : Transactions not made by you or anyone authorized to use your account are fraudulent, and federal law protects your money. This is not fair and Wells Fargo is not protecting their customer. There are federal regulations for banking consumers and Wells Fargo is not abiding by the rules in my case. Wells Fargo apparently has had many issues with this according to my research I have been doing to be able to get this money back that was stolen from me. I know about the federal banking regulation E which isa set of regulations issued by the Federal Reserve that governs all manner of electronic transactions. That includes XXXX. Their statement We believe these transactions were made by you or persons authorized by you due to the fact that your PIN was used, etc etc. Is not true because the withdrawal/transfer of money was NOT authorized me no matter what they believe. This is costing me time and effort and energy and frustration to deal with. I have spent so much time on this fight so I want every single penny that was taken from me. I want the full {$550.00} which was stolen from me.Please help. Thank you"
4/17/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,My first Wells Fargo account was closed without a warning or notification.

At XXXX, I received a notification from XXXX stating that a new recipient had been added to my account. At XXXX, {$500.00} was sent through XXXX to the unknown recipient. At XXXX, another {$500.00} was sent through XXXX to the previous recipient. At XXXX another new recipient was added to my XXXX and {$500.00} was sent to that recipient. At XXXX, another unknown recipient was added to my XXXX and {$500.00} was sent to that unknown recipient. At XXXX, another unknown recipient was added to my XXXX. At XXXX, {$500.00} was sent to that unknown recipient. At XXXX wells Fargo sent a Fraud alert on a {$1000.00} to an unknown place called XXXX. This transaction was denied by Wells Fargo due to fraud detection. At XXXX I woke up to use the restroom and checked my phone and saw transactions and fraud alerts from Wells Fargo. I immediately called Wells Fargo and indeed flagged the fifth XXXX transaction attempt ( which occurred at XXXX ) as Fraud and was able to decline it from processing. With the Wells Fargo representative on the phone, we reviewed all the accounts and identified the fraudulent activity. Once identified, the representative closed my online banking to prevent further damage and informed me that someone would reach out to me in the morning. At around XXXX another representative from Wells Fargo called me to further identify the fraudulent transactions went over the fraud precautionary guidelines with me. We closed the affected accounts and opened new ones in their place. Five days later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from Wells Fargo that a credit was issued for the {$400.00} transaction that was done through the XXXX XXXX as it was verified to be fraud. I then called Wells Fargo to inquire on the other {$2000.00} in transactions ( Four {$500.00} XXXX transactions ) and was told that my case was closed and that I had authorized or personally performed those XXXX transactions. I explained that this was not the case and that all these transaction happened within the same time period that morning of the XXXX and that 3 were identified as fraud. I clearly stated to the representative that the case needed to be reopened and insisted that all these transactions were fraudulent and absolutely were not authorized by me. I decided to go to my local branch and explained the situation in detail and also provided proofs of the alerts that I had received. The representative opened another case and within two days, that case had also been closed claiming, once again, that I had authorized or personally performed those XXXX transactions. Once again I went back to the XXXX branch to speak with the representative to inform him that the case had been immediately closed again. He resubmitted another case on our behalf. On XX/XX/XXXX I went back to The XXXX Branch and spoke with another representative who offered to submit another claim on my behalf but I declined since all other previously submitted claims have gone to deaf ears. I was then connected to the Claim Escalation Department who then connected me to the XXXX Investigation Department. They advised me to send a letter to Wells Fargo. On all of the claims that have been submitted to Wells Fargo, not once have they reached out to me to provide me with a status on the claim. I've had to call each time to get the status of the claims only to find out that all of the claims have been closed. Wells Fargo keeps insisting that I've preformed these transactions even though they have identified three out of the seven to be fraudulent. All of which occurred within the same date and time span. In the meantime, {$2000.00} has been stolen from my account and Wells Fargo does not want to take any responsibility."

I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told his online access would be frozen. When I saw more money was stolen that night, I called on XX/XX/XXXX and was told they would not speak to me without power of attorney since it was stolen from his personal brokerage account. The unauthorized person took money from our joint account on XX/XX/XXXX so I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. After my debit card was cancelled, the checking account number changed, and being told I could not get checks because they had an old address, I was told the person who has hacked his account still maintained all access since they can't do anything unless he calls himself. ( Again, he is XXXX XXXX ). 

When I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to get the account number and find out how to restore my online access since that was cancelled as well ( even though the criminal 's access was not! ), the man began investigating the fraud again instead. when I told him that had been done and I just wanted my account number, he told me he had to investigate. He was asking me a list of questions that no one asked when I tried to report the fraud the day before.

all the Wells Fargo answers I received regarding this issue are misleading and excuses that are not related to this problem. 
1- For more than Two years and more than Fifty complaints now I am trying to fix this issue with Wells Fargo that does not indicate any existence. it is like talking to walls. 
Today also I received a letter from Wells Fargo regarding my account to my physical address. 
The Wells Fargo employee 's policy seems to be that lies will wash the problems. 
The more lies those employees are doing the deeper the problem is getting. 
Wells Fargo has no managers on duty, the executive employees are working from the comfort of their homes doing whatever they please with the customer 's account without any regard to the laws and regulations and without any regard to customer privacy preferences. 
This bank has no website or email contact for complaints ; this is why most of their customers come here to complain. 
Even the Wells Fargo employees who answer to the complaints here do not tell the truth and do not try to find a solution, they only answer by misleading statements. 
2- every time we sign into our Wells Fargo account, we face a large pop up that covers the whole page it is destructive and annoying and waste of time and tricky if you click on the page you will be switched automatically to paperless statement, it is difficult to find a way to close it and more difficult to get rid of it even after more than 6 months and more than 20 of complaints this issue has not been solved. 
Wells Fargo 's employees seem to be working without any supervision and the bank is running without good management. A good management for sure will not accept this to happen to the customers. 
At least Wells Fargo should respect the privacy of the customers and follow the privacy preference as indicated on the customer 's account. 
but to whom we complain other than to CFPB. when the Wells Fargo Employees and the supervisors and the managers and the CEO are never on duty to serve the customers, but they are always at the comfort of their home doing whatever please them without any regard to the customers. 
I am not expecting a true answer from Wells Fargo for this complaint as my last Two years ' experience convinced me that I will not hear the truth from Wells Fargo. 
Notice I have been a Wells Fargo customer for more than THIRTY-FIVE years and I never had to complain this way till Two years ago when Wells Fargo moved the customer service overseas, changed management and CEO. 
I attached copies of many of the Wells Fargo letters that I received illegally to my physical address and i have many more to be provided upon request. So, Wells Fargo can not lie again and say only one letter was sent to your physical address."

I WAS INCARCERATED IN XXXX. I wasn't released from prison until XX/XX/XXXX. THE {$800.00} SECURED CARD somehow was charged {$2000.00} FOR A RENTAL CAR while I was incarcerated and somehow the {$800.00} card accepted the {$2000.00} FRAUD CHARGE. FIRST OF ALL, WHY WOULD A {$800.00} SECURITY CARD EXCEPT A {$2000.00} CHARGE IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE TO ME ANYWAY I WAS INCARCERATED AT THIS TIME I HAD OVER {$2000.00} IN MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND SINCE MY SECURED CARD WAS LINKED TO MY CHECKING ACCOUNT. IT WIPED OUT MY BANK ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THESE FRAUDULENT CHARGES WITH A SECURED CARD THAT SHOULD'VE NEVER EVEN ACCEPTED A {$2000.00} CHARGE. So when I got out of prison in XXXX XXXX I thought I was getting out with money in the bank but come to find out I owe Wells Fargo over {$2000.00}. My first two months out of prison, I had to deal with Wells Fargo and at the end of it. Three years later it still hasn't been resolved. I haven't gotten one phone call from them. I have to call every time and when I do call nothings done, I sent them in the paperwork my PO officer gave me showing them that I was incarcerated during the time of these charges so it would be impossible for me to have made them and yet still they have not done anything to resolve this issue and they have not contacted me trying to resolve this issue at all all the time that we talk to him because I had to call them and see what's going on and every time I called him asking why I haven't. Why wasn't I called this time it is always something to do with how your number was wrong. I'm like I just re-updated my number. Last time we talked it's been three times ago. Oh it was one number wrong in the number it's ridiculous. Wells Fargo are a bunch of crooks it's been proven time and time again that they shouldn't be in business at all"
4/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Dear Wells Fargo Bank, Thank you for your response to my XXXX claim, but I would like to further discuss the denial of my claim. Your response states that the transactions were made through a secured online banking session by me or someone whom I gave authorization to. 

However, I would like to reiterate that I did not give anyone permission to make this payment, and I have filed a police report and even undergone a lie detector test to prove my innocence. Additionally, when I contacted the bank, I was informed that all the XXXX accounts that the money was sent to have been disabled and that I was not tied to any of the emails registered under their XXXX. 

This suggests that my personal information was leaked, leading to someone sending the money from my bank. I would appreciate it if you could investigate the recipients ' accounts and provide me with more information to help clear my name. Furthermore, I want to emphasize that when the claims specialist called me, they informed me that my account was logged in from Texas and XXXX, despite me living in XXXX, Utah. 

The fact that my account was accessed from locations I have never been to before suggests that my account was compromised. I immediately changed my account username and password after being informed of this. 

In your response, you also mentioned that there was a history that the device that made the disputed XXXX transaction dated back more than 60 days, and that the same device was used after I changed my username and password without the online fraud claim assistance center. 

However, this does not prove that my account was not compromised and the money was sent to a strange account, as I have never authorized such transactions before. I kindly request that you take my situation seriously and investigate this matter thoroughly. I believe that I am not at fault, and I should not be held liable for any unauthorized transactions. Please let me know what further information or documentation I can provide to support my claim and help resolve this matter. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

In the new response, I was asked to contact the recipient and the recipient bank. I do not know the recipient and their bank because like I said this was an unauthorized transaction. Please give me a call or email discussing my options of recovering the funds or I would have no choice but to take legal action to do so. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
4/18/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"My husband and I went into Wells Fargo back in XXXX for a regular fixed rate mortgage ( term 30 years ). We began making payments. The mortgage loan was for {$80000.00} ( XXXX XXXX dollars ). Fifteen years later -- -we still owe more than {$52000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars ). Our payments were not fixed. The payments ranged from {$420.00} to over {$1000.00} a month. We are both XXXX since XXXX XXXX XXXX. We wrote to Wells Fargo and they sent us back tons of paper saying that we agreed to some kind of equity loan. That's not true. We simply asked for a fixed rate mortgage. Each time that we went into the bank, we said we were paying on our mortgage, after some time, the teller would find our account and have a strange look on their face for a brief moment. I always wondered what was on the screen the teller looked at.So far, they've gotten about {$240000.00} from us. We still owe {$52000.00}. As a minority, we believe we were taken advantage of. We believe we are victims of predatory lending by Wells Fargo. Can you help us? It's XXXX and will still owe {$53000.00} and have made all of the payments ( even during the pandemic )."
4/18/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"XX/XX/2023 TO : CFPB Wells Fargo recently sent a letter dated XX/XX/2023 to all customers who have a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. We contacted them several times in the past week, getting various responses and no resolution. They are requiring that we use a business account instead of the current personal account to make monthly ACH payments to that loan. The loan was set up 9 years ago with WFB and with a monthly ACH payment from our personal account, per their instructions. This is a "" personal '' loan with collateral of a commercial building that we personally own and receive rent from its XXXX occupants. It makes no sense to open yet another Wells Fargo account, and there are $ costs involved in doing so. According to Wells Fargo in my recent phone calls to them, this is a "" corporate '' change in policy, and that they are receiving many complaints. Once again, Wells Fargo is bilking customers to improve its image with investors, I believe. Think of the numbers of new business accounts that will be added! 
My husband and I are owners of a small retail business LLC which rents space in that building. The additional bookkeeping that will be caused is not insignificant. We currently report as rental income and expense on our personal tax returns Schedule E. 
The letter states we have until XX/XX/2023 to change the ACH payment method from a personal to business account or automatic payment from our personal account will be stopped. 

Thank you for looking into this matter. Something just seems wrong.

4/18/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Last summer we were victims of significant cyber theft because someone ( or some group ) accessed or electronically stole one of our ATM debits cards. They went on an ~ {$27000.00} spending spree over a 2 month + period. 

We discovered the theft in early XXXX, reported it to our financial institution, Wells Fargo ( WF ) immediately, and the local police in our hometown. I spent 6 hours on the telephone on a Saturday with the WF fraud claim group in the XXXX. 

Since filing my claim on XX/XX/XXXX, we have yet to receive a phone call from anyone from WF. I received four e-mails stating back in XXXX that the bank was working on our claim. Weve made at least a dozen phone calls since and each time we get routed to the same XXXX fraud desk. Only on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, did WF finally assign us a case worker with the title, Executive Office Case Worker. This person only has a first name ( male ) and last initial. The telephone extension given in his letter to me is not a working extension when I call it. My Case Specialist explained through a letter that they can do "" no more '' on our behalf. The last phone call we had with a person in early XXXX, was a representative in the XXXX. He nearly had me repeat the entire history of our claim again. This rep mentioned that the institution had three months to act on our claim from XX/XX/XXXX and was legally obligated ( agents words ) to be complete by XX/XX/XXXX. 

The fact that no one returned our multiple calls or responded to written letters, e-mails, and a spreadsheet that demonstrates all of the fraudulent purchases made with our ATM card, originally lead me to wonder if the perpetrator ( s ) was actually and employee of our bank. I sent a letter to the banks lead counsel expressing this hunch concern. She has yet to respond. 

Many of the fraudulent purchases that were made were random. Some of the stores dont even exist as far as we could tell. There are bogus insurance policies, vacation stays, fitness club memberships, ballcaps, t-shirts, endless on-line purchases, cable bills, and so on. Other than one very large on-line store, weve never used any of these services, shopped at any of these ( bogus ) stores or used vacation services, etc. Some of the stores were located outside the US ( XXXX ) and purchases were made while we were on vacation. 

The pattern recognition software that WF normally deploys should have recognized this and at least sent up a warning flag to contact us like it had so many times in the past. Where was WF 's security? Their fraud department used to call if they recognized an inconsistent spending pattern. For example, one year, WF alerted us and asked if we were about to pay for an expensive dinner in XXXX. That theft attempt was thwarted because of fraud protection software. There are other examples too. Why didnt they at least call us about the XXXX charges over two months and the ~ $ XXXX of purchases? Does the security software no longer operate? If anyone or any machine was looking at our account, it would easily recognize by just reviewing our monthly statements that something was wrong. The precedent our bank set years earlier within their fraud protection led us to think that it would at least provide the same service. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, WF repaid approximately half of our claim by depositing ~ {$14000.00} into our account. Although we appreciate the gesture, its still a long way from resolving our total claim of ~ {$27000.00}. 

I asked our bank multiple times to see a list of which charges it reversed so we could compare it to the fraudulent purchases on our bank statements and organized in the spreadsheet we attached. The Executive Desk said they will not release that information and that they believe they have done all they can. They mentioned that they have a 60 day policy that essentially states that they will only go back 60 days from the date of claim, XX/XX/XXXX. I mentioned that if this were correct, then it would capture more than 95 % of all the fraud charges we stipulated from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The bank still says they will not release the records they used to determine why theyd only repair ~ {$14000.00} and not the total ~ {$27000.00}. 

Please help."

After the advance, his outstanding balance on his HELOC was {$100000.00}. Upon locating the loan agreement, I contacted Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. I sent them a letter since I had several questions upon becoming POA. I included the loan agreement, HELOC statements from XXXX XXXX and XXXX  copies of advance draft checks that I could locate ; XXXX  were initialed by bank personnel and XXXX  were not. I asked them to waive the advance and apply it to the balance of the loan, because it was in violation of the loan agreement and should not have been authorized. My request was denied.

4/18/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"The afternoon of XXXX XXXX I was on my computer getting ready to check my work schedule. XXXX contact support message came up. It said they had locked my computer for protection and I needed to contact them. I contacted them at XXXX XXXX on the XXXX. The employee name that he gave me was XXXX XXXX employee number XXXX. I was on the phone with him for over an hour and a half, he tried to help me fix my computer. First he had me trying to hit R and ctrl at the same time to unlock it. When what he was doing didnt work he told me I would have to try to fix it from another device. He had me download the app XXXX XXXX. He said that would allow us to fix my computer from my phone, or at least figure out where the virus came from. The address for the XXXX XXXX was XXXX, he had me also look at my IP address so that way he could help me get into my computer. He helped me go through my phone and check all the security settings. We got an XXXX XXXX verification code. He told me not to tell anybody, not even him. We went through my emails trying to figure out where the virus could've come from. I found two emails from XXXX warning me about XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. He also told me that theres something wrong with my XXXX deposits in my bank. After that he told me he was going to continue to work on my computer but I need to to get in touch with my bank to make sure my money was safe, he said that he would connect me which he did. 
My phone was connected and the regular, Wells Fargo introduction played. I followed all the prompts that I always have when I called Wells Fargo. I asked the Fraud department. The Wells Fargo employee that came on stated I was speaking with XXXX XXXX. XXXX asked the reason for my call and what was going on. After explaining to him, he said he would have to verify this XXXX employee which he put me on hold and did. When he came back on he said he would call me back from a secure number a few minutes later my phone rang. It said WELLS FARGO with the phone number appearing on the back of my card ( XXXX ), and he had told me that they did find two transactions. He knew my account numbers and the balances in each account, ( who would have the information except my bank ). They stopped one transaction that was from XXXX for XXXX because there was not enough money in my account, he said but they did approve an {$8200.00} purchase from XXXX. A lady had called the day before at XXXXXXXX XXXX and had all my contact information, my social security number, address, birthday, phone number and the Wells Fargo employee approved the purchase. I asked if there was anything that we could do to stop it and save my money. I was crying at this time, freaking out. Told him that was all the money I had to support my kids and myself for the rest of the year. The bank said it was too late because I had already been approved, but he would try and see what we could do. He put me on hold so he could contact the XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX 
When he came back on the phone he said there was something that they could do to help me. They could put my money in a safe deposit account while the bank investigated the XXXX transaction, but they would have to prove to XXXX that the money had already been spent so that way they could reject the purchase, He told me that I had to go down to the bank and get my money out of my savings and that way I could put it in the deposit account and get a receipt. Then they would be able to prove to the XXXX bank that the money was not there. I really got so scared, crying to him about being a single mom with XXXX kids. I needed that money to support them. He told me to breathe and calm down. He said this is your bank, I'm here to help you but can not unless you calm down. He told me to not trust anyone, at this point not sure how the person that was using my Identity got the information. That my phone lines were probably not safe and I had to be extremely careful with moving the money. He also said how he hoped that he was really speaking with the real XXXX XXXX. I asked if setting the account up would take long due to my kids having the last soccer game of the season, which he also talked to me about later on to calm me back down when I was freaking out scared. 
He told me to go to the bank and pull out the amount of the purchase XXXX. I asked if I should just pull out the total of my savings which was XXXX he said no just need the amount of purchase that is being disputed. He said to keep him on the line while in the bank for safety reasons to just put in my purse. I requested the withdrawal from the teller, she never asked me what I needed the money for and allowed me to pull it all out at once. After I got the money like the Wells Fargo employee told me to. He gave me two addresses to figure out which one was closer to set up the safe account. XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX up going to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, it was located in a XXXX XXXX  station. He told me to breathe and be careful driving, everything was going to be okay. He said he was going to put me on hold while contacting the Investigators with the XXXX XXXX so they could send me a link to set up the safe deposit account while they worked on disputing the transaction with XXXX. 
Once I got to the location he did send me a link/Qr code, and told me that it would be on the right hand side when I walked in the store. He knew the location of the machine. I used the link then I set up my own account using my own ID and my own social security number, so I thought it was my own account. He said for my safety to wait in my car until it was verified. After I put my money in it to the safe account that was set up. I was so scared at one point while putting in the money some guy came in and threw a black backpack beside me. Also I thought I heard someone say she's at XXXX when I was putting money in the safety deposit account. One of the XXXX Dollar bills would not go into the machine, had the employee try to exchange it and she could not. He said he would contact investigators to let them know why XXXX short once done. He told me once we got the receipt thats what we could use to prove to XXXX that the money was not in my account and that he would be back in contact with me within an hour. Once all the processing had been started and that my money should be back in my account in 24 hours. 
I was trying to make it to the end of my kids soccer games and I had called my boyfriend freaking out and he said, what did you do? At that point I realized what a mistake I had made. I contacted the XXXX company. They said that it had already been completed. My money was gone. Contacted Wells Fargo again, asked them to freeze my accounts, and had credit people freeze my accounts. I put in a claim with Wells Fargo and after I called the cops. XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX Police came to my house and took a report. He told me also to fill out an XXXX report which I did. 
I dealt with Wells Fargo many times over the next few days, shaking and crying every time I called the same number and followed the same prompts I did the night all my money got stolen. It is so hard to trust them now. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I went down to Wells Fargo to unfreeze just my check to pay my mortgage. When the lady at Wells Fargo checked she said they never freezed all my accounts, just the savings that the withdrawal was made out of. I said that account is empty. Why would I be worried about them stealing from that account? I was so upset they just left all my accounts that had money in them open so the scammers could steal the rest of my money after I had called them on XX/XX/XXXX to have everything frozen. They even disabled my online banking option. I did get all the accounts frozen in the end except my Checking. 
Wells Fargo said they denied my claim, I asked if they could look at it again, I did as the bank instructed me to and I lost all my money. I trusted them. I have had an account with them since XXXX. He sent my claim to the XXXX Office Case Specialist. XXXX XXXX was the employee assigned my case. Case number XXXX. He took a statement from me and said would contact me with any other needs. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I received a secure message from Wells Fargo. I called XXXX XXXX to verify it was them. I freak out with any emails. He verified I and discussed the claim with me. He was awful. He even chuckled at me saying I'm not going around in circles with you, no one stole your money, you were scammed and gave it away. I said no they stole it, I thought I was doing what my bank told me to do to save my money. He chuckled at me at least one more time saying sorry but it was my fault. 
I called the advocacy dept but they said nothing else to help me with. So I researched the Attorney General 's office. I spoke with XXXX XXXX who told me who else to reach out to. I have to keep trying. That was all my savings for my family.

4/18/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo transferred servicing of my loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. They claim to have sent an "" information packet '' to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which would show me as the authorized user ( the loan is in the name of an estate I am the XXXX of ). As of XX/XX/18, XXXX has no record of me and therefore will not discuss the mortgage with me. Despite WF 's claim that the loan would be transferred exactly as it was, XXXX does not show the COVID forbearance in place and therefore has the loan as 6 months past due. XXXX has also issued payment for taxes that were already paid. WF refuses to provide any information as to what was sent to XXXX, thereby shielding themselves from any claim of failure to exercise proper care in executing the transfer.

She went over several of my charges on my card and confirmed that the charges I had were mine and which ones weren't and then stated we needed to close the account and open another one. She sent me text messages that were from the wells Fargo number to confirm who I was and then proceeded to shut down my card and my account. After a few minutes she came back on and stated she was going to wire transfer {$25000.00} to a new account and do the rest after just to make sure it all goes through the correct way. So when she was done doing that we proceeding to go over shutting my debit card down when the call dropped. When I called Wells Fargo back they made me aware it wasn't them and it was a scammer and that they didn't know if they could get my money back. The number this person had called from was the Wells Fargo number as well as the text message as well as they were looking at my account statement while I was on the phone with them. This is a major security issue with Wells Fargo. When I first got on the phone with this person I called the number she was calling from on a different phone and it went to Wells Fargo so there was no way for me to know any difference. This is not my fault and Wells Fargo needs to get better security

I was put in a forbearance durning the pandemic which I caught up with, but they mismanaged the account and never took me out of forbearance even though I was paying! Many conversations with them, one person tells me to do something and another says to do something else! What a mess! 
I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and trying my best to keep the home my dad and I built many years ago. I XXXX XXXX XXXX company which suffered terribly during the pandemic and still hasnt come back yet. Im trying my best to work with them and although they have offered me other options each option they have offered, cost me {$2100.00}. As I explain to them on many occasions I dont have this much money to give them each month. Ive spoken with many people there and have had many problems along the way. The harder I try to work with them, the harder they work against me, although they said they are helping, they are not. Now theyre sending me letters of foreclosure even though I am paying them something each month. But that payment that are putting towards past interest, so its like Im not paying anything! If I dont pay the back interest of {$12000.00} by XX/XX/2023 they will foreclose on my home! 
I explain to them that I own another property with my cousin, a house on the beach which we are negotiating to sell. When I get my half of the money I plan on paying off this loan. I did explain that to them but they are not willing to wait and just let me pay some thing in the meantime. 
You are my last resort! 
I need to get this straightened out, I can make the payment of {$1400.00} and pay my own taxes and insurance, but they wont let me! 
Please help Thank you"
4/18/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter stating that my monthly payment will increase above {$1800.00} amount due to insurance escrow shortage of {$6000.00}. XX/XX/XXXX I called to see how we can work something out cause I don't have that kind of income to pay such a large amount with other bill being shorted to survive. They informed me of programs that are available such as modification and refinancing for an additional 30 years. I asked for lowing my interest rate due to the fact I made payments on time and always made a way with the insurance, which is the lowest in can get due to company 's leaving the state and living close to a lake of water does not help in anyway. So I asked about the XXXX and XXXX area homeowner rate and they could not give me an answer. My wife and I applied with many companies, but Wells Fargo were the only one that gave use a loan on XX/XX/XXXX. We signed a loan agreement for {$150000.00} at APR of XXXX with monthly payments at {$1500.00}, my credit rating score at the time was XXXX, hers was XXXX. Was told that we would be able to get it lower once our credit improved and when it did in XXXX they refused us due to late payments and not creditable worthy enough. Over the 26 years I would find lower insurance and payment with to {$1400.00} or they added escrow differance to the end of loan end date extending the years of payout. I have been doing my best to improve credit to XXXX to get better APR but all they do is try and get me to do 30 more years loan or other programs. More sacrifices I don't have in me at my age."
4/18/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Incorrect information on your report,None,"I am part of the XXXX  XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX and am XXXX of the original members whose land was listed in the public notice placed in the newspaper involving XXXX other property owners. I am a member of FBI Case Number XXXX where it has been proven that all the banks are committing Mortgage Identity Theft and XXXX other crimes when they foreclose on any property or land. Frankly, they steal, and you are allowing them to take our house, land, equity, title and leave us with nothing. When are you going to stop allowing these crimes to happen? Aren't the people paying your salaries? Don't you take an oath to protect the people? 
I am also part of the Department of Justice group action where they found the banks have in fact committed crimes and are in the process of paying out the money WELLS FARGO was ordered to pay for fraudulent practices. I am not the criminal here, WELLS FARGO has shown they consistently do criminal practices under XXXX XXXX, then XXXX and now WELLS FARGO. Seems as though the government is oblivious to the crimes or are you a participant with them? XXXX owns thousands of acres, consolidating all properties under XXXX umbrella and you are allowing it. Have you sold us out? Are you conspiring to kill the people and own all their assets? So sad that it has come to this! 

My grandmother is dead, she died in XXXX. Ask WELLS FARGO why they foreclosed against a dead woman? Why they brought her note from XXXX XXXX XXXX  that no longer existed because she was dead. I settled her note and the deed of assent says the property is owned fee simple. Yet you foreclosed against a dead woman in XXXX, when her estate was already settled. You lied to me many times, I settled with you again and you lied again. The Legal Notice you ran in the newspaper was against XXXX XXXX. If she did business with you, how did she? She was dead? You have no wet-ink signature. You are defaming my grandmother who was a civil rights leader who worked in the community for XXXX  years, be careful of how you destroy her name sir! 

I am so tired of explaining to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and others. WELLS FARGO conspires with these companies to commit fraud because they have been provided settlement, have XXXX and have been provided settlement again. Since lying WELLS FARGO employees want XXXX  days to investigate something they have investigated many times in the past, according to the Fair Debt Collection Act they are supposed to take the disputed item off the credit report while they investigate. I guess WELLS FARGO makes the rules, I guess they don't have to follow the law, I guess XXXX money can buy you anything! When are you going to stop WELLS FARGO from damaging the people! They have killed me in commerce, financially slaughtered my character, economically held me XXXX until I have suffocated and now my vessel in commerce is dead. How am I supposed to live? I am a living woman who has the same right to live in peace on my own land but WELLS FARGO continues their deceitful tactics and their conspirators XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX help them perpetuate the fraud. According to United States Code Title 15 Subsection 1601-1666 Pertains to WELLS FARGO 's bad banking practices. Consumer Law - 15 USC 1602 ( I ) Credit Card - used my Social Security Card as funding to pull credit, so what has WELLS FARGO lost? They are liars! Truth in Lending 15 U S Code 1605 Determination of Finance Charge ( what they aren't telling you ) - Finance charges should be provided separate from the rest of the document, but you WELLS FARGO loves small print and comingles all the charges together. ANY transactions that I have ever done with WELLS FARGO have been settled many times over plus when I had my business account their they got full benefits for the income I put in the bank from the business. They kept title to the securities deposited because according to their records the securities were abandoned. If the public school system and universities trained us to operate in commerce we would know and America would not be on the verge of finance collapse! This is WELLS FARGO and their gang of banking criminals ' fault!"
4/18/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,Our home was foreclosed on around 2006 and Wells Fargo sold it almost immediately. They never told us it was in foreclosure and did not give us the opportunity to sell it ourselves.. We tried to refinance the home prior to this event. Wells Fargo said everything looked good. When I tried to send in the cash for the refinance Wells Fargo told me to go to the courthouse and pay it there. In the courthouse is where I found out my home was being foreclosed in front of everyone in that court room. I never had the opportunity to keep or sell my house. Wells Fargo profited XXXX. Or more from my house the difference in the amount owed to their sale price. We never saw any of that money. Nor was my foreclosure reported to the credit bureau!!!! when I called them to ask why I was told by a female employee named XXXX that she made that decision to foreclose as a kindness to us. There was a woman at my door within a couple of days named XXXX XXXX to evict us giving us three days to get out. I tried to see a lawyer named XXXX XXXX here in my home of XXXX Texas. He told me Wells Fargo was a huge wealthy company and that there was no way I could ever win anything against them. He would not help me. We were left homeless and very very traumatized and personally heartbroken to loose our land and tge home we built on the land thaf we previously owned.
4/18/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"After the first complaint I filed, was told to bad Wells Fargos records of our account show that no XXXX  XXXX payments were made. I have been able to prove they had been made. Not denying it just sorry but its not enough. Ok, Im dealing with and talking about a company that has been sued and fined 20+ times. Now the Cfpb sends all complaints about Wells Fargo to Wells Fargo! Ive been able to prove the XXXX  XXXX payments, sorry but again there records prove different, Oh they say they only go back 7 years. So Wells Fargo can only go back 7 years and XXXX XXXX only to XXXX. This all changed when XXXX XXXX saw the bubble burst coming and began insulating themselves from any lawsuits in the future, by claiming they were never aware and if they were they were not willing and knowingly involved with Wells Fargo and XXXX payments through XXXX XXXX. I have said since I filed the original complaint. I know we made the payments and we were not behind. I have said since the beginning, I took my receipts from XXXX XXXX, and I was told that I would have a number wrong or switched. I have those actual wires and on them you can see, the 4 that wasnt wrong, thats what I was being told repeatedly! It started in XXXX when we first bought the house. Its still continuing to this day. I didnt send all the papers for Wells Fargo to inform me that we had been late or not making payments. When Im fact we were and had made our payments. The blatant strealing started basically as soon as we signed the contract with Wells Fargo. As you can see we made payments from our bank account that shows up months after the actual date of payments. We were making our regular house payment and literally bring bombarded with final notification, the mortgage statement sending payments to XXXX MD, XXXX final notice from North Carolina,! the amount of bills and statements. The XXXX XXXX receipts that started in XXXX showing proof of payments to be told I was off a number. I filed complaints with Wells Fargo as early as XXXX, not knowing that XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were just blatantly stealing everything. In XXXX XXXX. I. One month of payments between XXXX XXXX and bank payments! We payed and payed. I have never changed what I have said regarding Wells Fargo and their out right criminal actions and activities for so long. Now with the help of the Cfpb, Wells Fargo, XXXX  XXXX, still are robbing consumers. I have proven time and time that all my statements have been true. We are asking for XXXX XXXX dollars now since its the 3rd time filing a complaint to be told that oh well you dont have any proof. This proves no matter how or when or what payment process we made, Wells Fargo has continued to refuse to compensate us for now the 22 + years, never denying what Im claiming, because what I have claimed has been true. So knowing this and knowing we were and had always been making our house payments, on top of the years and years of double triple billing claiming we never made the payments. So we would have never should have been to a loan modification let alone one that raised the principal and extended the payments for another 30 years. The forced bankruptcy, add the health damage to my wife. Knowing she made everyone of the payments only to be told we were past due. In one month XXXX. In XXXX. The mortgage statements are not even right, XXXX shows we never had a loan modification. I want XXXX XXXX for the fact I have proven with our first 3 complaints. Wells Fargo is still allowed to run a criminal enterprise along with XXXX XXXX and the Cfpb. This is why no consumer can get any type of restitution from years and thousands and thousands of dollars stolen. Stolen by our mortgage company and the payment services they insisted we use due to the easiness they together made for us. Now Im retired with limited funds my wife is now disabled, mainly due to the stress of dealing with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX, which in turn caused a genetic disorder to take over again due to and still the stress of all this. When I should just get a call as to were to wire our money. Wells Fargo claims they can only go back 7 years XXXX XXXX can only go to XXXX. Good thing I have XXXX of just illegal and blatant stealing of every payment made, XXXX  XXXX , our bank account, it didnt matter Wells Fargo took them all."
4/19/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"In XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX I was advised of a financial settlement by Wells Fargo for their slimy fraudulent practices. The settlement instructs Wells Fargo to negotiate with the plaintiffs. I have submitted documentation of the havoc Wells Fargo has wrought on my life. Since XXXX, I have been strung along while they researched my claim. To date, nothing. I have even been denied access to their legal counsel. I reiterate that the judge ordered negotiation. They stated they are unable to find documentation. This, although I was told that there is proof that a fraudulent account was opened at a branch near my old address. It has been proven that this was a scam to inflate WF customer base. Even with their executives facing jail time. Ive been advised by counsel that even if WF computers were decommissioned, hard drives are bagged as evidence with a subpoena issue. This was demonstrated in an action against XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do intend to contact my senator and representatives regarding bringing forth my concerns to whatever financial committee can be advised. I have attached pictures of the paperwork from years ago, one of which has the credit card with a limit of XXXX dollars maxed out and a letter from a collection agency. Honestly the level of aggravation and chaos, to not even be able to buy a car or have a roof over my head is incalculable."
4/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"Id like to respond to a previous complaint to Wells Fargo on a mortgage issue. I was advised an 7 year ARM rate of 3.25 %. I confirmed with the loan officer over 3 times that we could use the higher XXXX score of my husband even though Im the higher wage earner. I was further told that I could lower rate by another 0.125 % with {$250000.00} moved over to Wells Fargo. However after I applied I was told that the best rate is 3.5 %. They suggest that I move over XXXX so I can get 0.125 % rate discount, knowing the fact that I should have received a rate of 3.125 % with the deposit. This is a clear violation of Truth in Lending Act. Its bait and switch tactic used by the bank. I could have gone with XXXX XXXX XXXX with a better rate. The bank responded by writing me a {$200.00} check and explained that rate can change during underwriting process. This is totally untrue given that Ive provided all the required documents and my XXXX scores and locked the rates of 3.25 %. The rate changed to 3.5 % not because of you identified any red flags in my credit profile but misrepresentation of the loan officer. Its humiliating to mitigate with {$200.00} check knowing that 0.25 % difference in interest rate on a {$850000.00} loan would make a difference of over {$14000.00} in 7 years ( the loan is 7 year Arm ). Its extremely frustrating as the lender notified me of the raised rates two weeks into the underwriting process where we had no choice but go along with it given that weve waived loan contingency and was at a crunch to closing! Its beyond frustrating to think that Wells Fago has done this to other borrowers during the loan process and tried to settle with a {$200.00} check when someone reports their act."

I was up to date on my payment and had made a down payment but I ran into a wall dodging a deer. I never knew the specifics or even what the gap coverage was specifically for. They did contact me like 8 to 10 years later.. Saying they probably owed me some money but didn't have the right paperwork.. As if I would have paperwork on a car that got totalled a decade ago. I honestly don't even remember what insurance company I was with at the time.. I think this was Wells Fargos plan the whole time. 
Especially since I put a down payment on the car and was current on the payments and I don't believe even a year went by."

They claim the charges are valid but at the same time say they are not insinuating I made a false fraud claim or false police report. Well not sure how else I can take it. They also say it is unlikely that a fraudster would make charges in a similar area as another fraud claim I made. Fraudsters will commit fraud where they have been able to do in the past. 

I can not drive due to eye issues caused by XXXXXXXX XXXX so I could not possibly drive to the location in question which they claim is 16 miles from where I live. I have filed for XXXX because of this XXXX and attached the paperwork I had to fill out for my XXXX  claim. I ca n't drive, no one drove me to the location. The fraud occurred during the day and my husband is not home he is at work so he could not have driven me. 

I nor anyone else known to me made these fraudulent charges. I can't afford to pay for something I did not buy. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and never shop at extravagant places like XXXX XXXX. My budget is limited. I've even resorted to having my husband take me to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to get free food. 

Wells Fargo keeps saying the same thing when I file a complaint - charges are valid and they are not and they are not insinuating that I made a false fraud claim or false police report. In reality they are accusing me of making a false fraud claim and false police report - otherwise how could they continue to say the charges are valid."

4/19/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"On the morning of XX/XX/2023 I received a phone call from a Wells Fargo number claiming to be the fraud department the number that showed up on my phone was XXXX. With Wells Fargo name under it. I answered the man on the phone proceeded to tell me he was with WF and gave me a name and a badge number. I can not remember either. 
The person on the phone Told me there was fraudulent activity on my account and that they needed to verify I was actually me and that they would be sending me a code. They did and I read it back to them. ( Which this IS what they do when you call the fraud department ) He starts going over all my recent purchases to verify and then gets to a wire transfer of {$10000.00}. I tell him that is definitely not me doing that as I need my money to pay for my mortgage and business rent. He then tells me that they were able to flag it and that he also was turning back on my notifications because the fraud person had deactivated them. So then I had a notification pop up on my phone and tell me a wire transfer of {$10000.00} had just been made. I screen shot it to have for my records and tell him what popped up and he said oh yes not to worry as thats just the original message coming through since I had turned your notifications back on. 
Then he brings up my XXXX account and asks who a XXXX is and I said she is my friend and it looks like a transfer of {$3000.00} was made to her. I said well she is my friend and definitely not trying to steal money from me and he had asked if I could call her to send the money back because they didnt want to flag her XXXX account for fraud and she would not be able to use her account any more. He asked that I call her and merge the calls. I call my friend XXXX and the line with the fraud WF guy was disconnected. 
I proceed to tell her everything that had just happened and she logs in to her account and can see my {$3000.00} pending in her account. 

Then I get a text message ( XXXX ) from the fraud WF guy saying this was his direct line if I was able to call him back and I did and merged the calls so my friend could be on the line as well. She proceeded to ask who he was because it sounded off to her. ( She also owns her own business and has had scammers trying to redirect money ) They both started yelling at each other and I said ok everyone hang on and asked the fraud WF guy if he was able to flag the wire transfer why couldnt he flag the XXXX transfer. 
He says hold one moment please come back a second later and says Oh everything is taken care of, thank you for calling Wells Fargo, goodbye Immediately I call the Wells Fargo fraud department that I had looked up on the actual Wells Fargo website, the same exact number that had originally called me and got in touch with some one and explained everything that had just transpired. In between me crying and relaying all the information he reassures me that everything is going to be fine and that they would take care of everything. 
I filed a claim XX/XX/XXXX that day for the wire claim of {$10000.00} # XXXX is my claim number. I spoke with about 3 different WF fraud department people the rest of the day, just to make sure I wasnt missing anything and also to make sure I was getting the same story from everyone. One of the real fraud department people told me that they had changed my XXXX account to be linked to theirs and that had my friend sent back the money that it would have gone to the Scammer. So I asked him if you flag her account for fraud will hers be shirt down and he said yes. So I said we know this wasnt her and I dont want anything to mess with her account she is going to the back right now to pull the {$3000.00} cash for me. And he said ok so we dont have to worry about that. And he was able to restore my XXXX back to normal. 

I asked what my next steps should be and we proceeded to put a hard hold on my personal and business WF accounts. And over the phone he was able to reopen my personal but for my business I needed to head to a branch. 
Around XXXX I went to the XXXX  XXXX WF branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) again I went over everything that went on earlier in the morning and he was able to help me reopen my business account. And gave me some papers my husband needed to sign as well since we both are owners of the account. 

In the middle of all of this my husband was calling me to get updates and my phone would not ring but go to someone elses phone, a XXXX number with a Spanish speaking VM. It was then we learned they had also hacked into my phone. I had to call my carrier XXXX XXXX  and they had to completely delete me from their system and add me back on. I also had to complete erase my phone and start over. 

In the multiple times of me calling to get updates and info one of the very first things the WF would say is ok Im going to send you a code to verify you I kept telling them that is EXACTLY how this entire thing started and that if I felt more safe I needed to go to branch. 
I brought those papers back in after the weekend since it was XXXX and spoke with another branch member also to restore my access to my online account to just go over everything and make sure everything was done. He assured me the cards had been ordered. 
I was calling as much as I could to get updates and make sure I didnt miss anything, debit cards or CC that needed to be ordered and also was told that my wire claim could take up to 10 business days to be resolved. I called on day 4 and spoke with as lady to just get and update, she proceeded to tell me that everything looked fine and it didnt seem like I was missing any information and that I called in time to have this handled and the only thing left for me to do was really wait. 
I called again on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, because I still had not received any of my CC or debit cards for my new accounts and come to find out they had not sent them out. 
I have also had to speak with my property manager for my business because at this point my rent is late and in our contract if rent is over 7 days late you will be served with an eviction notice. My mortgage is also late. 
Today is XX/XX/XXXX, we are on business day 10 and I have yet to receive an update, so I call the wire claim number and was told that my claim was denied due to the fact that it looked like this person logged in from a new device and sent the authentication code to an authorized user and it was correct. I proceeded to tell him everything again that had happened and that even when you call they say that to you for you to verify yourself. All he said was I can put in a request for the person that made the decision to call you and go over that information with you. I was very upset in and he said you should definitely tell them this because this is very valuable information and I asked if he was actually going to call me. 
I am at a loss and dont know what else to do. Please help."
4/19/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"In XXXX of XXXX, my 20 year Wells Fargo ( WF ) Heloc reached maturity. I owed a balloon payment of $ XXXX at the maturity date. I realized in XX/XX/XXXX that I would have a problem paying the entire amount that I owed. So instead of modifying my loan or refinancing the $ XXXX, I asked for and was granted forbearance. I understood the rules of the forbearance ; I would be still be responsible to pay the total debt including any suspended payments. I also understood as stated on page 2 of the forbearance letter I received from WF every quarter of the 12-month suspension If you can make a payment even a partial payment you can do so whenever you like. This will help reduce the amount youll owe at the end of the payment suspension period. My forbearance started in XX/XX/XXXX. I did not make a payment in XXXX and the interest was suspended as per the rules of the forbearance. Going forward, my plan was to make a {$3000.00} payment every month for the remaining 11 months of the forbearance so that the debt would be basically paid in full when the suspension ended in XXXX of XXXX. That is exactly what I have done. I have sent a {$3000.00} ACH payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX to WF on or around the XXXX of every month. Problem is, WF only applied XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments respectively. The rest of the payments ( 9 ) staring with XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX have not been applied towards the balance of my loan as stated in the forbearance plan. WF returned XXXX, XXXX, XXXX & XXXX of XXXX and XXXX, XXXX & XXXX of XXXX payments to me each month in check form. XX/XX/XXXX payment is missing and unaccounted for and of this date XX/XX/XXXX XXXX payment is unaccounted for. I dont get it. I followed the plan as explained to me and WF decided to change the plan without an explanation. 

In addition to the forbearance nonsense, WF has sent me a loan modification application twice, in XXXX of XXXX and again in XXXX of XXXX. Both times, WF has made the claim that my loan is delinquent and that foreclosure is eminent if I did not fill out the application. This account is not now or has ever been delinquent. My understanding is that this action by WF would be the CFPB definition of dual tracking. This is illegal in Illinois.

I have made numerous attempts to contact WF by phone, through email and by letter, but they refuse to answer my questions or complaints. I am supposed to have an assigned case specialist who is never available. I have recorded myself leaving voicemails on both my case mangers voicemail and her managers voicemail, but they both refuse to contact me back."

Still, it took time for me to start receiving benefits. Meanwhile, my debts were spiraling out of control. I even filed for bankruptcy as a measure to buy time to work something out with Wells Fargo.

On XX/XX/2023, I called XXXX and spoke to a representative, she identified this {$70.00} interest as an error and promised a refund of the {$70.00} interest- she also gave me a case number. Furthermore, XXXX mailed me a letter dated XX/XX/2023, stating that on XX/XX/2023 XXXX credited {$51.00} back to my credit card, and on XX/XX/2023 XXXX credited {$19.00} back to my credit card. This did not happen as XXXX explained! 

On XX/XX/2023, XXXX did credit {$51.00} back to mt credit card. However, on XX/XX/2023 XXXX added a {$19.00} charge to my credit card. On XX/XX/2023 I called XXXX and questioned this charge. The representative explained that it was supposed to be processed as a credit so the two credits ( {$51.00} and {$19.00} ) would sum to a credit of {$70.00}. Basically, the charge should have been a credit, and I will be receiving two {$19.00} credits now on my next statement in XX/XX/2023- she apologized for this mistake and gave me a second case number. 

When I received my XX/XX/2023 statement, I discovered that no credits were processed and in fact the {$19.00} was debited from my WF checking account as an auto-pay transaction. On XX/XX/2023, I called XXXX and spoke to a third representative that provided a third case number, and apologized for the continued mistakes, and she explained she will request a new case to be opened for review. 

XXXX is continuing to add bogus interest charges to my credit card and erroneously taking money from my checking account as payment for those bogus interest charges.

4/19/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited {$5200.00} ( {$780.00} & {$4500.00} retirement checks ) in my account via ATM machine. However, I forgot to endorse the back of the checks. I had called the customer service line and was told there is nothing that they can do. The hold is on my account until XX/XX/XXXX. I have a house closing on XX/XX/XXXX so I made an appointment to come in the bank to see if they can release the hold sooner. I was told by XXXX XXXX the banker who called the "" check '' department ) that the hold will be released on XX/XX/XXXX and the checks will be sent back as uncollected funds. XXXX suggested that I called the company issued the checks to request a stop payment and have them re-issued the checks ( since my closing is on XX/XX/XXXX ), I left the branch and within 5 minutes I called retirement 401k company to request stop payment. I was told that those two checks had cleared on XX/XX/XXXX meaning wells fargo had collected the money. I drove back in the branch and was told that they do not discuss with me and I have to make appointments and the earliest appointment is tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. They told me to call customer service line again because it is customer service issue now. I spoke to 3 different specialist including two executives and they said they can not do anything for me. The last one tried to act like she couldn't hear me and then disconnected the call. I need help in retrieving my money since the retirment company showed the checks had cleard but wells fargo stated that they do not have my money. PLEASE HELP."
4/19/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"Case : On the fourth day of XXXX XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  in the afternoon my wife receives a call from a representative of the Wells Fargo bank where we have our checking and savings accounts. 

This person pretending to be an employee of Wells Fargo, asked me if I had ordered a check book in the state of California, and I replied that no, we have no relationship with California. The person asked me to send him a security code back, opening the dial number pad and I did it as instructed. 
Wells Fargo usually asks for a security code in other transactions we have made with the bank ), This person told me that he needed to close the check request claim, and that is why he required the code. The call ends, which lasted about XXXX minutes. 

Half an hour later I received a text message from Wells Fargo telling me that the wire transfer was in process. 

I check my account on my cell phone, and discover that {$24000.00} had been stolen. I immediately called the Wells Fargo fraud center to report that I had not authorized any wire transfers from my account. The attendant was unable to obtain my personal information by checking my account, and I decided to personally go with my wife, to the Wells Fargo XXXX in XXXX, FL. 

We arrived at the Branch around XXXX : XXXX to XXXX in the afternoon, and we were attended by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX called from his office to the fraud center to report the case and to try to avoid the wire transfer. After a few minutes, he told me that we would have to wait for Wells Fargo to open the investigation but that there was some information that could be useful : XXXX XXXX reviewed the transfer and told us that it was made to a Bank in New York called XXXX XXXX XXXX, to the suggested account : XXXX. The company that apparently made the transfer is located in Florida, and the name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX contacted this bank XXXX XXXX the next day and was informed that this account is from another virtual bank to which they provide services. 

XXXX XXXX recommended that we report the case to the police, and I did so the next day. 

The next day I report the case to the police. Case number : XXXX. 

The police report stated : On XX/XX/2023 at XXXX hours, I was directed to call the victim, *** who resides at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in reference to XXXX. XXXX stated yesterday, XX/XX/2023 at XXXX hours, he received a phone call from XXXX. He spoke with a male who claimed to be with the Wells Fargo XXXX Department. The male asked XXXX if he had ordered checkbooks to be delivered to California and XXXX stated "" No ''. The male requested he input numbers on his keypad followed by an asterisk to resolve the issue. XXXX did as he was requested, and the male stated the issue was resolved before hanging up. At XXXX hours, reviewed the transaction history of his Wells Fargo XXXX account # XXXX. He observed a wire transfer of {$24000.00} to a XXXX XXXX XXXX  account # XXXX belonging to XXXX XXXX XXXX had been approved at XXXX hours. A XXXX search of XXXX XXXX XXXX shows XXXX addresses associated with the business, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Florida. Having not authorized any transfers or having done any business with XXXX XXXX XXXX, he immediately went to Wells Fargo XXXX He spoke with a manager to report the fraud and mentioned the telephone call he had received at XXXX hours. The XXXX informed XXXX that Wells Fargo had never called him and the code he had input in his phone was an authorization for the transfer. The XXXX directed XXXX to file a police report and stated Wells Fargo would open an investigation into the incident. At this time XXXX has not been refunded the {$24000.00}. He verbally requested prosecution and I provided him with the case number. 
Wells Fargo, I indicated the claim number : XXXX. And that he could call the number : XXXX. He also told me that I should wait 2 to 10 business days to obtain a status of the case. I called this number a couple of times to find out some status but did not get any information. They told me to call when the 10 days were up, and today XX/XX/2023 I called the bank and they informed me that Wells Fargo closed the case, and that they will not return the money."
4/19/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I mailed a check to my granddaughter from Florida to Georgia. The check was stolen and the name, date and amount were changed. It is very obvious to anyone that the check was altered but someone walked into a Wells Fargo branch and was told the amount of money in the account and cashed a check for {$7000.00} to completely wipe out my account.. Another check hit the bank the same day so the account became overdrawn. I was sent a notice from Wells Fargo that my account was overdrawn. I immediately checked the account and saw a check for {$7000.00} had been cashed. I went to the bank branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told they could not help me. I had to do everything by phone. I stayed in the bank and made the phone call. My current account was closed and a new account was opened. But I had no money or checks to pay my bills. I have made approximately 10 phone calls to Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX and have accomplished nothing except a runaround and lies. I contacted the XXXX Police Department and our local sheriff 's fraud department and filed a complaint. I contacted all of the credit bureaus and froze the accounts. I have not yet been able to speak to anyone that spoke good english and could give me any good information. Wells Fargo personnel constantly change the rules and things I am supposed to do. I was told it would take 2 to 5 business days to get my money replaced. When that didn't happen I was told 10 to 12 business days, then 12 to 14 days. Now that 14 days have passed an agent told me they were mailing me an affidavit ( supposedly mailed XX/XX/XXXX but I have not received it ). I am to complete the affidavit and mail it back to them, then they will start their investigation. The agent also told me they tried to call me on XX/XX/XXXX but I have no record of any call. I did receive a letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they would help me and to call a number. When I called the number the person said I needed the 8 digit code that was in the letter. I have had several people look at the letter and there is no 8 digit code. I asked them to send a text to my phone and I would reply but they said they couldn't do that. I was informed that without the XXXX digit code nothing could be done to help me. I am totally mentally exhausted from this frustration. Everytime I get to talk to someone after pushing many buttons on the phone they say it is not their department and the department that I need does not accept phone calls or emails. This is a nightmare. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and a widow. My social security and my husband 's federal pension have been stolen. Please help me."
4/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We recently filled a comment with CFPB, to intervene on our behalf to Wells Fargo the the results were very unsatisfactory and incorrect information was given back. The representative from Wells Fargo named XXXX who contacted me by phone, had assured me 3 different occasion that she would be sending a letter asking for detail. It has been two weeks and counting, she stated that the mail is slow, this was not a certified letter, and I do not understand why we haven't received it yet. I am expecting to see this letter. They have closed the complaint account without us having the availability to see what the letter was about, or for, or pertaining to this letter. I don't know how an account can be closed when there is incomplete information. This just proves, and verifies, the absolute circus of clowns that we have been dealing with from Wells Fargo over & over all these years. This is the exact thing that our original complaints covered, and the only thing we get back from Wells Fargo, is more continuation of flat out lies."
4/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo is the servicer of my mortgage, which is owned by XXXX XXXX. I want Wells Fargo to stop servicing my loan and return it to XXXX XXXX for the following reasons, which the CFPB should check into : - Not correctly removing a borrower from forbearance. They were supposed to take me out, but the representative messed up and did not process my acceptance of the modification. This took countless phone calls and time to get them to correct this last year. 

- After the nightmare of them not removing me properly from forbearance, they sent me a letter saying they could begin the foreclosure process anytime, when I was current. I called and no one could tell me why that letter came to me. Isn't it illegal to threaten to foreclose on a home that is current? 

- Currently, Wells Fargo has had my full payment since XX/XX/XXXX. Tomorrow will be a week since they received all the funds. They received the majority of the funds from the North Carolina Home Owners Assistance Fund back in XXXX but did not put it on the account for almost two weeks. I was waiting to make sure they put the funds on the account and then I made the remaining payment on XX/XX/XXXX. To date, I'm showing past due on their site, as I'm passed the "" grace period '' for my payment. Which they have the entire payment ( since XX/XX/XXXX ). I spoke with Wells Fargo to discuss this matter on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Both times, I was assured it would not go passed the grace period. These actions are absolutely unfair and deceptive acts and practices. How can a bank have your entire payment for a week, keep it sitting in "" unapplied funds '' even after the customer has called numerous times?"
4/19/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Check cashing service,Fraud or scam,None,"In late XXXX I deposited three checks in a Wells Fargo atm. As it was processing the checks, the atm displayed an error message and began rebooting. I panicked and waited in front of it in the hopes of getting my card and checks back. It gave me my card back, but not the checks. I called the number listed and filed a claim. Mind you that this atm is the only one in the entire city. Nine days later they adjusted the money into my account and sent me an apologetic letter saying that the money was put back into my account. Two months later I received a letter with a new claim number stating that an investigation was still ongoing. As it turns out, Wells Fargo started a new claim on my behalf and was looking for the checks from two months prior that were stuck in the machine. I sent them proof that the checks existed and the issuers of the checks confirmed that they had not yet been cashed. A month later they took the money out of my account and started another claim for me. Today I called asking for an update and they said there was nothing that they could do and to just ask the issuers to write new checks. The female representative said things like, its not our problem, people lose money in atms all the time so youre not the only one with this issue, we didnt take your money, a machine did, machines make mistakes all the time so youre not getting your money back, and we are not going to start a new claim for you. I have banked with Wells Fargo for over 14 years now and I even used to work for them. This was the most disheartening experience I have ever had and I still have not gotten my checks or money back nearly 5 months after THEIR atm kept my checks."
4/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Hello- I am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo online services. I live in NC and my mother lives in AL. I am the go to person for all of my mother 's accounts- whether it's banking, doctors, life insurance - I manage all of her finances. She has been missing payments a few times, but I always manager to help her get it paid- though she was making late payment too. My mother has XXXX 's - so sometimes she forgets to make payments. And that's where I come in at. So instead of trying to get to Wells Fargo bank, I tried to set up her account online to pay from my home for her. I attempted to go to Wells Fargo in NC ( near me ) to see if I can get this online service set up. They tried to help me but they could not get the issue resolved for me because Wells Fargo online services does not have a copy of my POA. I tried to get the issue resolved over the phone multiple times, but Wells Fargo customer service reps were very nasty. I was told they couldn't do anything for me because they don't have access to my POA. I've asked multiple times to fax it over to them. When I call they will not help me because they are saying they don't have my documents from Wells Fargo Mortgage. Wells Fargo Mortgage conferenced me in with them to let them know that my documents are with Wells Fargo Mortgage. But the online service staff still did not want to help because they couldn't see it on their system. This is ridiculous. I need to have access to the online service to pay my mother 's mortgage on time. I talked to at least 7 people in the online service IT dept. The 1st level, the 2nd level ( who was very nasty ) ... the next level hung up on me. Everyone that answered to this phone number, XXXX, I had issues with - over and over. I finally went to XXXX, AL to take my mother to the bank. One of the bankers named XXXX XXXX- was very helpful to try to get the account set up online. But again, I tried to get access and the system denied me from setting up the online account. Between the Wells Fargo bank in NC and the Wells Fargo bank in AL- neither of them could help me gain online access. But the IT people from the online service, probably could have helped but they keep saying they don't see any of my documents to grant me access. So, where do we go from here? I would really appreciate if I could get this resolved, so I can get online access to my mother 's account. I also have a mortgage account with Wells Fargo, but my main interest is getting online access for my mother 's account."
4/19/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Confusing or misleading advertising about the credit card,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to express my concern regarding Wells Fargo 's credit card program. My experience with the program has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. 

When I signed up for the credit card program, I was under the impression that it was a standard payment program, similar to other credit cards I had used in the past. However, I soon realized that the program was actually a fixed payment plan, similar to a personal loan, which required me to pay off the entire balance on my account within a fixed timeframe. 

This was extremely misleading and deceptive, as it was not made clear to me at the time of signing up for the program. I feel that I was misled into believing that I was getting into a standard payment program, only to find out later that I was locked into a fixed payment plan. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this issue and hold Wells Fargo accountable for their misleading and deceptive practices. Consumers deserve transparency and honesty from their financial institutions, and it is unacceptable for Wells Fargo to mislead and deceive its customers in this manner. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter."
4/19/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,None,"I was vacationing in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and my phone and credit card was stolen out of my pocket while walking down the street. I closed the credit card and reported my cell phone as stolen with XXXX, XXXX, and the XXXX Police XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message from an unknown number telling me that my phone was found and I had to log into XXXX to view its location. After inputting my phone password I realized I had been victim of a phishing scam to access my cell phone. About 30 minutes later I check my email and got a notification from Wells Fargo that I had used XXXX to send {$1000.00} to "" XXXX XXXX. '' I was able to track my call phone and it was in XXXX when the transaction occurred. Within 2 minutes I call Wells Fargo and report the fraud in an attempt to cancel the transaction before it completes but I was told that there was nothing they could do and after it was sent, the money was gone. They interview me and tell me they will open a case. A month goes by and I don't hear anything from Wells Fargo so I call them to get an update on the case and they tell me that my claim was denied. They said that after "" conducting an investigation '' they found that it was not fraud and the transaction had been authorized. I asked how they were capable of conducting an investigation without giving me the opportunity to provide any evidence. They then sent me to a de-escalation team. I asked to appeal the case and they person I spoke to told me that there was nothing they could do and they could not reopen the case. So I hung up the phone and called again in an attempt to talk to someone new, and the new person told me that they would reopen the case and they would send a letter to me home with information on how to submit documents to aid the appeal. The letter never came. So I call again about XXXX weeks later and again I was told they could not reopen the case and there was nothing they could do. So i hang up again in an attempt to get someone new and the new agent offers me an opportunity to reopen the case and gives me the fax number to submit documents to aid my claim. So I submit the location that my phone was at when the transaction occurred ( XXXX, while I was in Florida ) and the police reports I filed when my phone was stolen. It is currently two weeks since I submitted these documents and Wells Fargo still has not communicated anything with me about the claim or why they continue to deny it. 

- After previously filing multiple complaints against this transaction, the only response I have received is that it seems to have been an authorized transaction- without any evidence provided as to how that transaction could have possibly been authorized. The only thing I could think of is my Face ID was used to sign into the account, which it was not as I was on the other side of the world, without access to the device when the transaction occurred. Ive been told to contact local authorities which is pointless as the robbery happened overseas ( in XXXX ) and the fraud in XXXX, where local authorities have no jurisdiction. I have spoken with my lawyer and have been advised that I have enough evidence to proof fraud so I am prepared to take this matter to court if this continues to be dismissed."

The account holder did not release any consent or personal information because the call started off with the account holder 's account numbers and name. 
The account holder notified the bank via phone after the incident on the same day for suspicious and repeated phone calls from the bank and confirmed that the call was a scam. A dispute was submitted during the phone call on XX/XX/23, and in person, filed a complaint regarding non-transparency of fraudulent acknowledgment and accountability of the processes by the bank regarding notification of information breach. On XX/XX/23, a complaint was filed with the local police authorities.

4/19/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo Bank has caused me to lose a closing date on selling my home because of their gross negligence. I had a mortgage loan that was opened with Wachovia, transferred to Wells Fargo, and paid off with a Wells Fargo home equity line of credit. The lien from the 1st mortgage should have been released when it was paid off. 

When my closing attorney did the search twice the lien did not show up. However, during the prep for the closing the title company did a search and the Wachovia lien came up. 

Initially I contacted Wells Fargo in XXXX for the Wells Fargo home equity line of credit payoff and I received it XX/XX/XXXX for the 1st closing date on XX/XX/XXXX with no mention of the 1st mortgage being outstanding. I contacted XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo mortgage dept to clear off the 1st mortgage lien since it was paid off years ago, and he said it will be taken care of for my XX/XX/XXXX closing, however to date, XX/XX/2023, after 5 calls it is still not done and the closing was not able to take place yesterday!

I input the account information and routing number for the account at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. When the confirmation screen appeared, the bank name listed was XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did hit the confirmation button. Although I did not recognize the bank name, I do know that banks merge so it was not extremely concerning. Within the next few days, I did not receive the transfer in my account at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo by phone XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX. They stated it may take 2 to 3 business days. The funds did not arrive and I opened a dispute/investigation with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. After many days/weeks, Wells Fargo told me that the funds went to an account at XXXX XXXX XXXX that I was an owner or signer on and I should contact XXXX XXXX. I did that as well, see attached emails. In one conversation with XXXX XXXX, they explained that I am not a signer nor owner on the account and stated that my bank ( Wells Fargo ) should perform an ACH recall. Wells Fargo stated that there is no such option as an ACH recall. After opening serval claims, Wells Fargo stated that I had verified this XXXX XXXX XXXX account in XXXX of XXXX with small dollar deposits. I went back to every Wells Fargo account statement on file via on line banking and I did not have an account dating back to XXXX of XXXX. Wells Fargo finally told me that the account at XXXX XXXX XXXX  where the funds were deposited was in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have searched the internet for this business and found 3 companies with this name in Tennessee, Mississippi, Virginia. I have tried contacting all and none will return my call. I live in XXXX, Florida with no ties whatsoever to this business. I have asked Wells Fargo for all documentation used to investigate this claim, copies of the "" verification process '' allegedly done in XXXX, and asked for Wells Fargo to initiate an ACH recall. I have not received any documents of significance. See attached. XXXX XXXX XXXX  also stated that there has been no recall request from Wells Fargo. This transfer was in the amount of {$10000.00}. Wells Fargo has been unable to produce any documentation to prove that I verified this account in XXXX of  XXXX, nor has there ever been a transfer to this account in the past 6 years from my account. Wells Fargo claim numbers have been : XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, handled by on line customer service department, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX and XXXX, handled by the executive office XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, also handled by the executive office, XXXX This is a concise summary. However, I have spent over 30 hours calling, visiting both Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX emailing the banks, looking through my own records to see if there was any chance I forgot about an old account. What is terrible is that it was only after 20 hours of work and 7 weeks did Wells Fargo provide the receiving account name, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Had the Bank been forthcoming and honest with me as their consumer, I may have been able to contact XXXX XXXX before the funds may have been spent.

4/19/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"This bank has been robbing me blind for the past month and a half. Most recently they have helped themselves to over {$300.00} of money they are not entitled to in overdraft fees ( read illegal profiteering ) when they have been submitting transactions in the wrong order in order to steal more from me! I called and demanded at least 50 % in reimbursement only to get told XXXX you customer I have your money, I lined my pockets go away so I can steal more from you. 

This was the one and only olive branch that I was willing to submit to this company."
4/19/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I recently switched my banking to Wells Fargo including my personal checking as well as business bank accounts. After transferring all of my funds and conducting business transactions for almost two months, I received an email saying all of my accounts were being frozen due to 3rd party deposits that were being made by my tenantsXXXX as this was against bank policies. Without any other notifications or warnings, I immediately lost all access to my accounts online and all incoming deposits and scheduled withdrawals were canceled. After contacting the bank and explaining the details I was informed that in order to resolve the issue, all the tenants would have to go into a local branch and physically verify identities or the accounts would be closed. Unfortunately, this was not a feasible request of the tenants due to the fact that we are located in Michigan and the closest branch was confirmed to be in XXXX, Florida. After explaining this, I was told that all accounts would be closed on XX/XX/XXXX and a certified check totaling over {$12000.00} would be sent out by mail, which represented the additional funds in all 3 accounts that were unrelated to the matter. They stated that the {$2000.00} in question would still be on hold until the proper verifications were made. When I called today, XX/XX/XXXX, to verify that accounts were closed and check was being sent, I was now told that an extension was placed on the account closure until XX/XX/XXXX to give the people in question time to verify. I was also told that they will continue to extend the closure until verifications are made in person. I was able to escalate the call up to higher management and they understood and reasoned with me, but confirmed that there would be no way for me to obtain my funds until verifications were made and more than likely extensions would continue until then. I explained that I could provide several forms of proof to resolve this issue including lease agreements, copies of tenant IDs as well as contact information for all in question but that to expect these individuals to travel to Florida for a local branch was simply not realistic. At this point I am willing to forfeit the {$2000.00} that is unverifiable but the additional {$12000.00} that I was expecting to be released today should not be locked up in this situation. I even suggested that I could travel to Florida to at least verify my own identity and get my funds released but I was told that it wouldn't help unless all funds were verified first. I am literally in a position where I have to just sit and wait until the bank decides to actually close the accounts, which according to several representatives is not likely to happen anytime soon."

I personally never received payment options and I have the income to afford payments
4/20/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Virtual currency,Fraud or scam,None,"Commencing about XX/XX/2021, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX XXXX  ( the Company ), which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX XXXX  from my Wells Fargo account to fraudulent investment firm. 
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following ( i ) whether Wells Fargo did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Wells Fargos custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Wells Fargo promoted the transaction ( s ) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction ( s ) in question ( iv ) whether Wells Fargo was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Wells Fargo owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Wells Fargo did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Wells Fargos conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Wells Fargo has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me."
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"I have been unable to monitor my bank accounts properly for about a month due to hospitalization after car accident. During this time I am not sure who had access to my cards or phone. Upon coming home I noticed that both of my bank accounts had activity in the past month that were not just recurrent payments. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo for transactions from XXXX, stating that my last known transaction was from XXXX from XXXX for an amount of {$10.00}. These small transactions over the month totaled to around {$600.00}. Wells Fargo has denied my claim and I have talked to multiple representatives who all have different reasonings for why it was denied, all of which do not makes sense. One claim totaled 40 transactions with a total of {$510.00}, another of 10 transactions of {$120.00}, and a final one of 10 transactions of {$130.00}. The representatives were rude and disrespectful. I have spoken to all merchants involved who say I need to speak with my bank and that my account with them was hacked. Wells Fargo responded to my previous complaint with the same exact response, which is not a response. "" we found compelling evidence supporting the decision that was already communicated to you. We agree with the decision made by the Claims Assistance Center to deny your claim as we found the charges were made by you and no bank or processing error occurred. At this time, we respectfully decline your request for reimbursement. Please consider this claim closed '' Again they do not state the "" compelling evidence '' and I'm confused about how a bedridden individual in a different state made these transactions? So I will not be considering this case closed, and I will be taking this to a lawyer if I have to, and continuing to file complaints with the CFPB. They then tried again to call me at almost XXXX XXXX at night one evening. Their feedback back was not helpful, and they know that no police station will take me seriously if I walk in. Wells Fargo is losing a customer for sure because I will never trust them with my money again. I have cancelled my account and have tried to call WellsFargo multiple times regarding their feedback that they required additional information. I was hung up on twice before actually speaking to a representative who told me they did not know what additional information that was needed so they needed to reopen a complaint just to then receive an email saying it was closed because I did not provide the additional information!! How about someone actually call me on the phone and ask for the information. Or when I call back not hang up on me"
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,I have been multiple over draft fees of {$35.00}. For a day XXXX times. It happened often between XXXX. I should have overdraft protection. The mistake was the bank forget to link saving to checking. Besides that my credit score ruined by putting me to debt collection. For years and years now when they should be solving a problem first.

I contacted fraud and let them know the charges were removed now the charges were placed back on my account!!!! This is unacceptable!!!!!!! SOMEONE NEEDS TO CALL ME NOW!!!!! THESE ARE FRAUD and not authorized!!!!!!!!!!! 

These charges need to be taken off immediately as my card was stolen! When I called I was Informed they denied my claim because in previous fraud case that had been used at a prior merchant in a fraud claim even though the case was considered fraud. I can not control that my card has been stolen before and used at places in XXXX XXXX how is that my issue? There is so many places you can use this card. I never did business with these merchants or XXXX either its fraud my card was stolen. So was a few others and they already resolved their fraud claims in my favor. Get these off my account! 

Someone needs to call me now!!! XXXX"
4/20/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I assisted to a Dillards store. The lady at the cashier offer me a Rewards card. I told her many times that I wasn't interested in a credit card, arguing that she was offering a rewards card and not a credit card. 
I told her maybe 3 times that I didn't want to apply to a credit card, because I recently got my SSN and I was starting to make credit history and I knew that it might affect my score. 
She insisted that she was not offering a credit card, so I finally agreed to apply for the "" reward car '' that in theory would give me cash back or points as many stores do with XXXX cards. 
She intentionally cheated on her intentions and I unfortunately felt on it. Perhaps it was that Its not my native language."
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,I closed my account so don't have my account info. I think it was XXXX or XXXX. I closed my account because they kept charging me overdraft fees saying my money was not in the bank and I know I had deposited the money. They kept me in the negative and returning checks.
4/20/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"We are good citizens and believe in paying what we owe. 

Like many Americans during Covid, we struggled with keeping up with bills and the mortgage. In XXXX, we took advantage of the federally supported mortgage relief program and deferred payments for a few months. The loan was extended for the deferred period with interest. 

In XXXX, we continued to suffer financially, and we accepted another Covid related deferment. From about XXXX, XXXX, we deferred ( did not pay ) our secondary mortgage. In XX/XX/XXXX, we began making payments again, as was our understanding. And we have continued each month through XX/XX/XXXX. According to Wells ' 'help ' program offical documents ( which is acutally a new mortage - BS ), we owe {$1300.00}. For the past several months ( check the recordings ), I have repeatly sought to pay this, and with interest. Instead, just today, I got yet another forclouse notice. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a Wells Fargo rep. He told me I needed to decided how to pay the deferment almost immediately, or Wells may go forward with foreclosure. I immediately protested ( this is recorded ). 

Wells Fargos intimidating tactics are clearly part of strategy. Its wrong. Id be happy and would welcome disclosure of all our conversations, despite my frustrated anger and times. 

I would never do business with Wells and have been telling everyone I know to avoid them."
4/20/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"This will be my second complaint about Wells Fargo. The complaint is in regards to the previous complain I filed. Case number : XXXX. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX : XXXX. I received correspondence from the executive office at Wells Fargo advising me that the late credit marks on my report would be reversed. The marks include a 30 day, 60 day and 90 day late mark that was placed on my report in error because Wells Fargo did not apply the payoff in time to my account. I received a letter saying that only the mark from XXXX would be removed. I personally spoke with an executive from the Wells Fargo office and was advised that all of these late marks would be removed. To date XXXX XXXX all of the negative remarks are still reflecting on my credit report. I am requesting that all of these negative credit marks be immediately removed from my credit report. I was assured by Wells Fargo that this matter would be resolved and it still is not resolved. In addition this has had a negative impact on my personal credit."
4/20/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,High-pressure sales tactics,"I XXXX the response from Wells Fargo Auto Fnance, and XXXX actually responded that {$2600.00} for income was seen on the loan application. This should have alerted Wells Fargo Auto that this information was incorrect as I banked with Wells Fargo for close to eight years. I was turned down a loan for a mobile home on its own property XXXX years ago. 

This should have been enough for Wells Fargo Auto Finance to check my assets in my checking account. They are a guilty as the car dealership who I am currently suing. I have never had that amount of cash in my checking account, and Wells Fargo knew I banked with them. I do not accept their response."
4/20/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to notify them of many fraudulent charges that were on my credit card statement and to dispute these charges. I was never notified in any way by Wells Fargo about suspicious charges on this credit card and a representative from Wells Fargo confirmed this over the phone. All of the disputed charges were at XXXX and on my statement it shows it from an Arkansas based XXXX and the oldest charge was on XX/XX/XXXX and the most recent charge was on XX/XX/XXXX. There were a total of 101 charges that were fraudulent all from the same XXXX vendor . The fraudulent charges totaled {$8600.00} and the majority of the interest charged during that time is also attributable to these charges and it totals {$630.00}, and the single largest fraudulent charge was for {$260.00}. Wells Fargo responded by a letter in the mail and stated that all of these charges were determined by them to be legitimate and that none of them were fraud since they followed what they said is my normal spending patterns. I never shop at XXXX XXXX ever. Not a single charge at XXXX follows my spending patterns. I called them after this to dispute their conclusion and reviewed with them some of the odd spending patterns that were created. One oddity was nine transactions at XXXX in a single day and often times there would be 4 or more transactions in a single day. Another oddity is being charged exactly {$70.00} six different times in 2 days and also being charged exactly {$81.00} nine times over five days. I argued that this is not a normal spending pattern for any real person. They said they would investigate and send their response by mail which they did and determined again that none of these mentioned charges were fraud and that I am responsible to pay for all of them. {$3300.00} of these fraudulent charges happened within the last two statements when I notified them of the fraud and disputed the charges. And again, they never once contacted me by phone, text, email, mail, or internal message on their website about any suspicious activity related to a single one of these charges. Now they're sticking me with the bill for all of it and unfortunately I've already made cash payments for half of these charges."
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Wells Fargo bank is compromising my privacy preference and refusing to direct their mail to my mailing address which is a XXXX XXXX XXXX as I indicated on my Wells Fargo account profile. all the Wells Fargo answers I received regarding this issue are misleading and excuses that are not related to this problem. 1- For more than Two years and more than Fifty complaints now I am trying to fix this issue with Wells Fargo that does not indicate any existence. it is like talking to walls. Today also I received a letter from Wells Fargo regarding my account to my physical address. The Wells Fargo employee 's policy seems to be that lies will wash the problems. The more lies those employees are doing the deeper the problem is getting. Wells Fargo has no managers on duty, the XXXX employees are working from the comfort of their homes doing whatever they please with the customer 's account without any regard to the laws and regulations and without any regard to customer privacy preferences. This bank has no website or email contact for complaints ; this is why most of their customers come here to complain. Even the Wells Fargo employees who answer to the complaints here do not tell the truth and do not try to find a solution, they only answer by misleading statements. 2- every time we sign into our Wells Fargo account, we face a large pop up that covers the whole page it is destructive and annoying and waste of time and tricky if you click on the page you will be switched automatically to paperless statement, it is difficult to find a way to close it and more difficult to get rid of it even after more than 6 months and more than 20 of complaints this issue has not been solved. Wells Fargo 's employees seem to be working without any supervision and the bank is running without good management. A good management for sure will not accept this to happen to the customers. At least Wells Fargo should respect the privacy of the customers and follow the privacy preference as indicated on the customer 's account. but to whom we complain other than to CFPB. when the Wells Fargo Employees and the supervisors and the managers and the CEO are never on duty to serve the customers, but they are always at the comfort of their home doing whatever please them without any regard to the customers. I am not expecting a true answer from Wells Fargo for this complaint as my last Two years ' experience convinced me that I will not hear the truth from Wells Fargo. Notice I have been a Wells Fargo customer for more than THIRTY-FIVE years and I never had to complain this way till Two years ago when Wells Fargo moved the customer service overseas, changed management and CEO. I attached copies of many of the Wells Fargo letters that I received illegally to my physical address and i have many more to be provided upon request. So, Wells Fargo can not lie again and say only one letter was sent to your physical address."

Ive only received 1 escrow payments in the 17 years of making payments.

4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,I'm a long time customer with Wellsfargo I have a personal and business account with them. My complaint is Wells Fargo has closed most of their branches and has made it difficult to access ATM 'S. Foreign ATM 'S charges fee 's I live in a low to median income area. I notice others has notice that WellsFargo has multiple banks and ATM XXXX in XXXX areas but. not minority areas. This is clearly discrimination toward minorities and income brackets. I resides in the XXXX zip code the population here is XXXX the nearest bank is 15-20 minutes away. That wasn't always the case.
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"I received a cashback deposit from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX i received a mobile banking alert that my balance was now {$0.00}. When i went to log it to see what was going on i was advised my account was closed. I inquired via chat and via phone call as to why my account had been closed with no warning. Both times i was told they they would not discuss the reason with me and i would just have to wait for something in the mail. I did not commit any banking violations and Wells Fargos outright refusal to even explain the reason for the closure is outrageous. A month ago they had a technical issue that left me with a negative balance although i had just received my paycheck via XXXX. Im not understanding how a company who will erase all trace of peoples hard earned money is about to steal money from consumers and close their accounts at will and refuse to give a reason why. Furthermore, when i opened this account it was incentivized by a {$300.00} bonus that was to be credited to my account after making direct deposits adding up to at least {$1000.00} within the first 90 days that i had done within the first 2 weeks of account opening and now i am being told that on top of the unexplained closure, i also no long qualify for the incentive that was promised even after i had completed all requirements which is text fraudulent activity. Wells Fargo must be held accountable for the harm they have caused and continue to causes consumers."
4/20/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Problem getting a working replacement card,"On XX/XX/XXXX my card ending in XXXX was fraudulently charged 3 times by XXXX in the amounts of {$97.00}, {$5.00}, and {$30.00}. I immediately received notice of these charges from Wells Fargo via email and text. I called on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with customer service who stated she would file a claim on these charges, close my account ending in XXXX, and send me a replacement card. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo Claims and Recovery stating that We have completed our research and found that the unauthorized transactions that were reported did not post to your credit card account and will not appear on your credit card account statement. 

I called Wells Fargo today, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with one fraud rep by the name of XXXX who stated she could not find the above stated fraud transactions on my old account ending in XXXX. She looked at my new card/account ending in XXXX and advised that those fraudulent charges had posted on that account instead. She advised she would have to transfer me to her counterpart XXXX to assist me. I was then transferred to XXXX, who then reverified my personal information, I then explained the situation to her again. She advised she would document those above stated XXXX charges as fraud and close my account. She then cold transferred me back into a queue after which the line was disconnected. 

I once again, called Wells Fargos fraud department. Spoke with a new rep, who advised me she would document my fraudulent XXXX  charges, she confirmed that my new card ending in XXXX was closed/canceled, but then stated she could not processes a replacement card. She once again had to transfer me to a colleague to assist me with the replacement of my card. I was then transferred to a gentleman by the name XXXX I believe who after verifying me for the 4th time, stated he could not processes my replacement card and could not explain to me why. He just stated I needed to go into a branch. I ended the call and came here to report this. 

Wells Fargo, this is appalling. I am frustrated and disappointed with the quality of your employees. I am questioning my future with you for my banking needs. 

I want the fraudulent charges from XXXX that I initially reported on my account ending in XXXX to be removed from my account. 

I NEED a replacement card for the account that was closed and that has the fraudulent charges showing on ending in XXXX. These XXXX charges were pending when I reported them on my card ending in XXXX, obviously they posed to the replacement card ending in XXXX. XXXX not sure how difficult that is to understand."

My account balance is XXXX so he took that XXXX and deposited it into a new account. The banker who called me ended up being a scammer and he took my {$2700.00}."
4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"My complaint has to do with misinformation from a Wells Fargo phone agent that caused me to lose {$8600.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited 3 checks ( {$1300.00}, {$3000.00} and {$4500.00} all from XXXX, my mother 's long term care insurance ) mistakenly into my recently deceased mother 's checking account. I did it by way of mobile checking. However, I did write the correct account on the endorsement. 

My mother 's checking account has both my estranged brother and myself on the account. My brother cleaned out the account previously unauthorized by me. I realize I can not do anything about that. 

After I mistakenly deposited the XXXX checks on XX/XX/XXXX, I IMMEDIATELY called Wells Fargo customer service. I spoke to XXXX and the call was recorded. I needed to know what I could do to get to the money before my brother took it out of the account. XXXX told me I could only transfer {$400.00} at that time as the rest needed to be cleared. We transferred the {$400.00}. I asked him if he could move the money or have me move the money and he told me that it was definitely NOT possible. I would have to wait until XXXX when the money would be cleared. I should be at my computer at XXXX to make sure I transferred the money into the correct account. I asked multiple times if there was any way the money would be available sooner and he said definitely NOT. I asked if there was anything I could do to stop my brother from accessing the money and he recommended NOT putting a Hold on the account. He did recommend having email notifications sent to me which he "" supposedly '' did. I also asked if the system would recognize the correct account number on the endorsement and he said it was possible that if would get kicked back. I was on the phone with XXXX crying for approximately an hour. The only other thing he told me was to contact the fraud department but that turned out useless. 

I woke up at XXXX and checked the account only to find that my brother had already transferred the money. I called WF again and they said there was nothing they could do but I could file a complaint. I did that 3 times as the first 2 times, they only looked at the fact that my brother was an account holder. Finally on my third time, I explained that I was filing the complaint about the misinformation I was given by XXXX. When the WF agent called me to tell me that they STILL wouldn't give me my money, I was shocked. Her response was that people make mistakes and XXXX will be trained to not do this again. Also, she told me that I should've received a notification in my email but if I did not, she said it was in my WF inbox. Well, I checked and there was absolutely NOTHING on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX! 

I'm outraged that Wells Fargo does not stand behind their Customer Service agents. I expect to get correct information at all times! The Complaint department rep said that I should've done due diligence and read all the account information. Isn't that why there are XXXX agents?!? I know they won't get the money back from my brother but shouldn't WF be responsible for information given by their Customer Service agents? 

Thank you for assistance in this matter."

4/20/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I opened a Wells Fargo checking account on XX/XX/2023, by depositing a {$2500.00} check written from my checking account with XXXX XXXX. I was told that {$220.00} of the check would be available immediately and that the remaining balance of the check would be available on XX/XX/2023. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that there were {$0.00} in my Wells Fargo account. Wells Fargo issued a notice that same day, stating that the account was "" inactive. '' I called customer service, and they told me that "" the Federal Reserve placed a hold on [ my ] check. '' I asked for more information on the hold, but they were not able to help me because it was a Saturday, and none of the bankers were working. 

In the meantime, I logged onto my online XXXX XXXX  account and noticed that the {$2500.00} check to Wells Fargo had cleared. Wells Fargo had in fact taken that money from my XXXX XXXX  account but was not releasing it into my Wells Fargo account. 

I called Wells Fargo customer service again on Monday, XX/XX/2023. They told me that my XXXX XXXX  account was flagged as "" inactive '' and that they were not able to confirm the validity of the account. They said my funds would be on hold "" at least '' until XX/XX/2023. I asked what would happen on XX/XX/2023, that would cause the funds to be released, and they said the funds would not necessarily be released -- that was just the soonest date that the hold could be lifted. Upon further questioning, it was clear they did not understand why the check was placed on hold and were just repeating some script they had for this type of situation. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX  that same day ( on XX/XX/2023 ), and they assured me that my XXXX XXXX  account was not inactive, that the check had been cleared since XX/XX/XXXX, and that any delays with the disbursement of funds was due to Wells Fargo, not XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo again, and they transferred me to their loss prevention unit. They said that I needed to ask XXXX XXXX  to fax them a letter stating that my XXXX XXXX  account was "" active. '' The following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to XXXX XXXX, and I personally watched the branch manager fax a statement to the Wells Fargo loss prevention unit. Four hours later, I called Wells Fargo 's loss prevention unit because Wells Fargo had not yet released the funds into my account. Wells Fargo 's agent told me that the reason for the hold was not that the XXXX XXXX  account was flagged as "" inactive, '' but because my Wells Fargo account is new and they need to verify all new checks that get deposited. I explained that what she was saying contradicted everything I had been told up to that point. I tried explaining to her that I faxed in a statement from XXXX XXXX  four hours earlier, as the previous Wells Fargo agent had instructed me to do. After telling me that she was transferring me to another agent because I had exceeded her "" 5-minute limit, '' she hung up on me. 

I called the Wells Fargo loss prevention unit back again on XX/XX/2023. This time, the agent said they reached out to XXXX XXXX  but were not able to verify that the account was active. I told the agent that I did not believe her because I had personally been to XXXX XXXX  and watched the branch manager fax a statement to Wells Fargo 's loss prevention unit verifying the validity of the account. She then contacted the loss prevention unit 's "" executive office '' and was able to locate the fax that XXXX XXXX  had sent. She then told me that the fax was not sufficient. They needed to speak to the XXXX XXXX  branch manager who sent the fax to verify its authenticity. I waited on hold while she called the branch manager, and she told me she was not able to reach her because it was slightly after XXXX XXXX local time. She told me she left a voicemail with the branch manager, and she advised me to call Wells Fargo back the following day. 

In the meantime, someone from a local Wells Fargo branch had called and left a voicemail on my phone, responding to a dissatisfied customer survey I took after opening the account. She said in her voicemail that the check was on hold because there were "" insufficient funds '' in the XXXX XXXX  account. She said she personally called XXXX XXXX  and verified that there were insufficient funds. There were never insufficient funds in the XXXX XXXX  account, so this person was clearly lying to me. 

The following day, XX/XX/2023, I called Wells Fargo 's loss prevention around XXXX XXXX They told me they were unable to reach the branch manager at XXXX XXXX. I asked them to keep trying to call her. They said they tried again and were unable to reach her because she was "" helping another customer. '' They then explained to me that they were holding my check pursuant to Regulation CC. I told them that they could not hold my funds for more than a reasonable time and that they needed to have reasonable cause to do so. She was not able to explain what the reasonable cause was, so she transferred me to someone from the Executive Office. 

The Wells Fargo agent from the Executive Office said she tried calling XXXX XXXX  but the branch manager was "" not in '' today. I told her that was a lie because the last agent who just transferred me said the branch manager was helping other customers. She then told me Wells Fargo placed my check on hold because it was a "" new account '' and because my XXXX XXXX  account was flagged as "" inactive. '' I explained the account was not inactive and asked her to call the branch manager again. She put me on hold to purportedly call the branch XXXX. When the Executive Agent of Wells Fargo returned from placing me on hold, she said : "" Ok, I released your funds. It was only {$2500.00}, so I released it as a courtesy to you! '' And she hung up the phone. 

I then spoke to the branch manager at XXXX XXXX  ( the one they were purportedly trying to reach ), and she told me she spoke to the Wells Fargo agent on the morning on XX/XX/2023, and she assured Wells Fargo that my XXXX XXXX  account was active and that the check had cleared."

A few moments later I called the Wells Fargo XXXX number and told them what happened. They stated they would look into what happened and issue me a new card ( they have done that ). On the next day, which was a Saturday, I went into the branch and told them the exact same thing. I also told them that they needed to check the ATM window outside where people withdraw their monies. The Customer Service Agent inside told me that they have nothing to do with the ATM machines outside because they were owned by another company. AND, I was also told that since I had already contact the XXXX number there was nothing else they could do. They printed me my Account History. 

The agent that took my information was quite "" nasty '' to say the least, saying things like UMMM! Yea! As if she did not believe me.

called Wells Fargo AGAIN and told them the same thing that I had told the other agent earlier. She took down more information, however, I have not heard from them in almost two weeks.

This delay in the transfer is in violation of standard banking practices and is causing me significant financial distress. Furthermore, I am outraged that Wells Fargo has held my money, which was already withdrawn from my XXXX XXXX  account, without any reasonable explanation. This is completely unacceptable and unethical, and I believe it raises serious concerns about the ethical standards of Wells Fargo.

I have perfect credit and I understand how payments/principle/interest works. I received the best interest rate from Wells Fargo Auto. I always pay extra principle on payments that have interest. I have never had an issue doing this as long as it is specifically stated in the notes section of the payment... .ex : $ 402 monthly payment ; {$150.00} extra to principle. Wells Fargo refused to apply the extra principle to my account. They said it wasn't possible until I was at least 3 months ahead on the 'regular ' payment, and at that time it would go towards principle. Therefore, even though I was paying down the principle, they were not applying it correctly and I was paying interest on money I had already paid them. After multiple phone calls and emails, lots of hours of frustration, I re-financed my loan in XX/XX/2021 through my local bank. I have contacted Wells Fargo today to ask about the class action law suit regarding these practices. They said since my car was not repossessed, I would not be qualified for this class action.

'' I called the bank on XX/XX/2023 and was told that I needed to go into a branch location for the hold to be removed. When I went and spoke with a manager she refused to remove the hold because the check was deposited at an ATM not in branch. I waited till today XX/XX/2023 because the check is under {$5200.00} and expected to clear today. The check did not clear and I called the bank again and they stated they could not remove the hold over the phone and to go back to a branch. The Wells Fargo ATM system has failed to recognize the cashier 's check is a next day item per Reg CC rules. The bank is unjustly holding my funds in the account and refusing to remove the hold even though when they do research they can tell the check deposited is in fact a cashier 's check and not drawn on my customer 's account but on XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX 's account. However, Wells Fargo as an institution refuses to honor the Reg CC rules and will not remove the hold. If this check was fraudulent i would understand but the failure here is in Wells Fargo 's ATM system not recognizing the check is a cashier 's check and the Bank refuses to correct this mistake.

Now Im bring told Im not on the account. I was told during annual reviews I was on the account for at least 6 years. No mention if I should have a beneficiary added. Using my power of attorney in conjunction with a letter from a doctor stating my step father was mentally incompetent to handle his financial affairs i thought I set up a joint checking account. This was done to prevent scamming on Wells Fargos advice. I could of named anyone to the account and named anyone beneficiary. Legally. This account was set up during the time period Wells Fargo was convicted of problems with setting up accounts. Either an inexperienced or untrained banker set up this account. I didnt know it at the time. The bank needs to correct whatever paper work they screwed up so I can close the account and withdraw the small amount of funds.

This has been the most unprofessional experience I have ever had in my life. I trusted wells fargo to help me and got screwed. 
The bank needs to correct their accounting error."
4/22/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"On XX/XX/, at XXXXXXXX XXXX  Imposter who identified as a Well Fargo Fraud Department employee was calling from a number, I saved in my phone contact XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. Imposter reference to the reason of the call is regarding two suspicious credit card purchases was being made in XXXX and an online wire transfer was setup in my bank account ( I have never heard of an Online Wire Transfer options in my account ). She advised will sent an Advanced Access code text message to verify my identity as well giving her permission to use the security code access to my bank account. At the same time that I've tried logging into my Wells Fargo online banking account, but I wasn't able to login to my account. Therefore, I've reset my online banking password on my personal computer without her notice until I couldn't login to my account with my new password. Then, I asked her why I couldn't access to my online banking account with my new password. The imposter said due to the suspicious activities in my account and your account was being locked. She tried to provide a temporary password and I refused to use it because I reset my password again. During our conversation, I asked her why I havent received any security alerts and she said because my online wire transfer alert wasn't setup. The she provided me with a number to dialed and I heard the recording said your online wire transfer alert has been activated. Later that evening, I found out my calls was being forwarded to the imposter. 
Finally, I was able to login to my account with my new password. Then I followed her instructions how to send the money back to her so she can reverse it. Her instruction was select the Online Wire Transfer column, enter {$19000.00} USD and send. Therefore, I did exactly what the imposter instructed me to do. After that, she asked to speak with my spouse reasons because this is a joint account. Imposter put me on hold and call my spouse on her mobile #. Shortly after my call was disconnected and she was on the phone with my spouse requesting her the advanced access code. While my spouse was on the phone, I asked my spouse do not hang up the phone because she didn't give the case/claim # before the call is disconnected. Suddenly, my spouse 's call is being disconnected as well. We waited 10 minutes, and my wife pressed the same phone number which the imposter is calling from. The call went to Wells Fargo Fraud department which the number is legit. This is our very first time we've contacted the Wells Fargo Fraud Department spoke with the real Wells Fargo representative at XXXX from my spouse 's mobile phone. The real fraud department representative said our account was already being locked due to a pending online wire transfer case was being filed. He asked, "" did we setup the online wire transfer '', and I referenced to a call from your fraud department at XXXX regarding the ID Theft and an online wire transfer fraud. and I told the real fraud department representative I was instructed by the imposter to send the suspicious the Online Wire Transfer to her so she can reverse it. That time, I'm realized we were being scammed and I told the fraud department representative do not release the transfer because we didn't intent to send it. He advised that we must go to the Wells Fargo branch to show any prove of our identity and he couldn't disclose any information with us. Then we left immediately to the nearest Wells Fargo branch in our town. After we met the manager, we were being questioning about did we receive call from Online Fraud department, do we have relatives in Florida, do we know the name of the person. Wells Fargo branch manager/banker have never disclosed to us any information but initiated a new checking and saving accounts. The banker said will take 10 days for the investigation. After I spent 4 days to update all my other account 's password and making sure the security alerts were setup correctly. Finally, I have time to go through all the email alerts in my account. Apparently, they took over my online banking account, changed my password, enrolled the online wire transfer, added two recipients and setup the online wire transfer from two of my credit card accounts total of {$16000.00} USD and {$2900.00} USD from my checking account. On XXXX XXXX XXXX I scheduled an appointment meeting with the Wells Fargo banker to find out what exactly going because Wells Fargo didn't disclose any information, they have not told us about the money was being transfer from 2 of my credit cards and cash was being transferred as part of the Online Wire Transfer. The Wells Fargo banker found out at the same time we called to the Fraud department on XX/XX/2023, at XXXXXXXX XXXX The fraud department called the number that was being forwarded to the imposter, and the last person who had control of my fund is the representative from Wells Fargo who released the transfer base on some questions they asked. I asked the banker what kind of questions you guys are asking but she didn't know, and I wouldn't be able to find out. Also, I said why the fraud department didn't request the imposter to show the prove of identity at the branch like us. 
Long story short, Wells Fargo have not taken any of our statement, each time they referred someone will contact us in 24-48 hours. Until today Wells Fargo fraud department representative had never contacted us but only received two claim denial letters, two claim denial emails from Wells Fargo bank regarding to no evidence found for the online fraud. That's the reason I contacted the Office of the Attorney General Identity Theft Program for advice. Also, led me to this complaint I filed today. 
I have all the call logs, test message, security email massage alerts and notes from the banker are documented so is my credit report checked found no breach or leaks of my Wells Fargo username. I have scanned every single device and found no virus, malware, or spyware either. Police report was filed yesterday per the Office of the Attorneys General recommendations because Wells Fargo said it wasn't required. On XX/XX/2023, I did file the XXXX and FTC reports because that what I researched online. 
The police report was filed on XX/XX/2023, at XXXX. Police report case # XXXX."

4/23/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,None,"On XX/XX/2023 at approximately XXXX, I was in my car on my way to my grandmas. My phone was stolen out of my car at a traffic stop nearly 5 minutes from my house in XXXX XXXX. I had signed into my online banking to check if I had enough in my checking account for gas money. As I was stopped at a red light with my window down, six men approached my car from the intersection where they were all huddled. One of the men blocked the front of my car to squeegee the windshield. I said I don't need it and was waving my hands no. As he continues to spray an unknown substance all over my windshield, another man quickly came up to my driver side window. He smiles at me saying do you have any money for us to catch an uber? I said I don't have anything. I was looking for something in my car to give him so he would be satisfied and walk off. There was now a third and fourth man siding behind my car, directing traffic around me as the red light turned green in the only lane going straight. 

Several people honk and race around us as he snatches my phone out of my grip. I tense up, scared to escalate the situation. My foot remains on the break so as to not hit the person in front of me. Just as quickly, he tosses his phone in my lap acting and acts as if hes taking a picture of his phone screensavers which was a XXXX XXXX code. He told me he was just going to send himself XXXX XXXX  for an uber. At this point, I was very worried. I didnt have XXXX installed on my phone. He was swiping through my apps and saw Wells Fargo opened from when I checked a minute before. 

He was buying himself time as he ceaselessly began messing with the brightness and wifi buttons on his phone in my lap. He's simultaneously yelling to the man in front of my car to work harder, to really hook me up, and pointing to get that spot or this spot. By the end of the interaction, I was saying I really have to go, please don't take all my money, that I live paycheck to paycheck and need that money he was most likely accessing to pay my rent. The man laughed it off nonchalantly and said no, of course not! He tossed my phone back in my lap and took his phone quickly. He charmingly and calmly told me to look him up with the photo of his XXXX XXXX code. He took a picture of it for me. He said once I get to where I'm going, I would be able to tip him for his friends washing my car windows. 

Driving off, I received a notification from my bank, Wells Fargo, that XXXX was sent to XXXX XXXX via XXXX. This person transferred the entirety of my checking account, leaving me with XXXX cents left. I have their phone number and a confirmation code from XXXX. I immediately pull over and call my bank. Due to the crime involving XXXX, two other bank agents told me they could do nothing and that I would have to call XXXX. Through a quick XXXX search, I learned I was enrolled in XXXX through a participating financial institution. This means Im required to reach out to Wells Fargos customer support team. I finally was connected to a third agent who opened a fraud claim for the wire transfer as I detailed the above incident. The agent told me Wells Fargo would reach out within 10 days for further information on the case and I was given a claim ID number. 

Meanwhile, I report this crime to the police once I hang up with the agent after the fraud claim is submitted. On XX/XX/2023, I identified the suspect via a photo walk through and the police worked to obtain a warrant. I was interviewed about the incident and after gathering my testimony, the detective noted he would contact me with guidance on how to proceed. The detective wasnt allowed to send my records to me. I was required to request my incident records formally and mail it in to another police department. This request period took a whole month. 

No one from my bank ever ended up reaching out for evidence and documentation concerning my case. On XX/XX/2023, I received a letter stating my claim was closed and there were no processing errors. I called Wells Fargo numerous times to request to reopen the claim and examine my documentation as I was a victim of two crimes : wire fraud and larceny. After asking for a manager at the Claims Assistance Center and being put on with a conflict management associate, the agents told me I would need to fax the records but failed to provide me with the correct contact information. My case has been delayed for over 60 days due to the fumbles of folks representing Wells Fargo. 

Wells Fargo and XXXX did not provide opportunities to support me after a crime was committed to me. I was met constantly with the excuse that my bank could do nothing and that sending a XXXX transfer was akin to cash. XXXX says its my bank 's responsibility to deal with unauthorized transactions. My phone was stolen from my hand and the offender emptied my account. I have the number the transfer was sent to, screenshots, police records, etc. I want to submit my claim with the proper documentation and proof."

Wells Fargo had a major outage in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been unable to access my online account since that time -- despite Wells Fargo 's claims to the contrary. 

Because I didn't have online access, I didn't have bill pay or statement access -- despite Wells Fargo 's claims to the contrary. 

After trying unsuccessfully to re-establish online access with Wells Fargo, I switched to another bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX 

In XXXX XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo reported me to the credit bureaus for non-payment on my credit card. That was surprising to me, because I hadn't used the card in over a year. They also never tried to contact me directly -- despite Wells Fargo 's claims to the contrary. 

I immediately disputed the charges with Wells Fargo. In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo informed me in writing that "" fraudulent charges will not post to the account ''. Unfortunately, they never removed the charges. And, they've never explained why they broke this promise. 

I went back and forth many times. Finally getting a full copy of my statements by XX/XX/XXXX. I sent another dispute, detailing the fraudulent charges. Hoping to get some acknowledgement from Wells Fargo. 

I am writing today, specifically because I have never received a formal response to my XXXX XXXX  letter. This is despite many communications with Wells Fargo during that time. It feels like they're just ignoring me now. 

This is a complicated issue. And I'm trying to simplify things here. Just tell me why you never responded to my XX/XX/XXXX letter. Why didn't you refund the fraudulent charges, like you said you would? 

As mentioned, I've been back/forth with Wells Fargo many times. A XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX dollars and a single customer 's credit report may not mean much to a large bank. But, I'm not going to give up, until they make things right."

These accounts appeared again on my WF online dashboard a couple of years later and I again, went to a local WF branch and had my name removed from these business accounts.

About 5 months ago, I closed my personal accounts with WF and was told that I still have business accounts with WF. Even though I was the one who created the business accounts and added a business partner later to the account, I was told it was their "" policy '' is that only the business partner could remove my name. Again, I had previously had my name removed two times before. I contacted my former business partner and he was told by another WF branch that my name is not on the account, even though I was shown a screen at another WF branch that showed my name still on the accounts. By all evidence, my name has never been removed from these business accounts by WF.

After closing my personal accounts 5 months ago, I just received a change of address notice from WF stating that my address has been updated on my personal savings and checking accounts. I closed these personal WF accounts and now like the business accounts WF continues to associate my name with accounts that I have previously closed."

On XX/XX/ I tried went to a Wells Fargo ATM located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX in order to deposit cash that I had in my wallet for about {$120.00}. 
The ATM was not accepting my {$100.00} to after the third try I told the ATM to return my money and left. 
The ATM did not return my card right there and then and left my session open long enough so that someone else had the chance to withdraw {$200.00} from my checking account. 
The next day I went to a Wells Fargo branch to make my deposit in person and there I realized I was missing {$200.00} in my balance. I called and filed a claim, which was assigned number XXXX Today, XX/XX/ I called to inquire on the status of my claim and I'm being told the bank has denied the claim, with the argument that : -The withdrawal was only {$200.00} and the bank 's reasoning is that if someone had access to withdrawing money they would have taken more, not just {$200.00}. 
XXXX, who refused to give any ID or last name and said that my claim number should suffice me at XXXX XXXX told me that that is the only reason the bank will disclose to me, because any other information being disclosed would enable fraud. 
-Says also that even if there is a camera at the ATM and they were able to see it was someone else withdrawing my funds from my account it is my fault because I left my card at the ATM, despite the fact that the ATM should have given me my card back when I took my deposit items back, required a PIN reentered with a new transaction, specially a withdrawal, and closed my session promptly to prevent this. 
The ATM is there to replace a human teller, under whose watch this would not have happened. In other words, for the bank 's convenience and lower cost of doing business. 
XXXX XXXX also states that if someone wanted to withdraw money from my account after I was done with the deposit attempt they would have had to reenter my PIN again, ( which I know I did not reenter ) but still my fault because maybe I let someone see it and the bank is not taking any responsibility. 
I have also been told the bank can not provide any written response at the time of this claim being filed with CFPB. 
Attached is a screenshot of my account transactions, showing the unauthorized withdrawal and and the deposit of the cash the day after, on XXXX XXXX  at the physical branch, when the missing funds were noticed."
4/24/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"I am filing this complaint because Wells Fargo has avoided to address the issues that they did that cost me to lose my home, my marriage, and everything I have worked over 30 years for. 
You can easily see that Wells Fargo is covering up the truth by the 2 conflicting reports created by Wells Fargo. 1 Stating she reviewed conversations, but couldnt find the most important ones. And then you have the 2nd representative stating they dont have any of the voice conversation. So here you can see they continue in the corruptive manner as they have been doing for years. 
How does a company that was found guilty of 11 Federal Felonies, Yet not one person went to prison? 
Because Its all about HOW MUCH JUSTICE THEY COULD AFFORD and they used their Billions of dollar to manipulate all the things they have unlawfully done. 
This evaluation process will never be fair or right when you have a Wells Fargo Representative being the one overseeing these cases. There should be someone who can stand in the middle and review these cases.. Not where Wells Fargo has control to manipulate everything the way they want you to believe they didnt do anything wrong. 

Wells Fargo Wrongfully foreclosed on my home when they mislead me through the HARP Program. 
HARP was a refinance process backed by the government. During this process I was misled believing Wells Fargo was putting me through this government back process to make sure most Americans would not lose their homes. Wells Fargo intentionally put me through a process to make it look as if I wasnt making my monthly payments. 
I have given the information that clearly shows Wells Fargo and their associates knowingly put me on a path to allow them to legally foreclose on my home. Everything that I was told to do, I followed. All the payments and the money they drafted was not applied to my loan, it was stolen by Wells Fargo. 
I have included a court hearing that was in Utah, Where a Guy was put through the Identical process that Wells Fargo put me through, and He was awarded his House back, and {$450000.00} for punitive Damages. 
There are several things that prove that Wells Fargo committed Felony Fraud, and Wells Fargo fails to address these issues. 
The Most important things that show these Corporate Fraudulent actions they committed, Which are all fact, Yet Wells Fargo continues to lie and only goes by what they what you to believe, and Never admits the truth. 





PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION - Here are the things Well Fargo did during all this. All to avoid showing the truth in the process they put me through. 

First, I waited over 2 months for a court hearing for a 6 panel jury and the judge to hear my case, and 2 weeks before the hearing, The Judge made a decision in favor of Wells Fargo without hearing the case. 
Why would he do this. He gave no reason for this decision, and its Because Wells Fargo Paid him off, This would have exposed their Fraudulent actions without any doubt. 

Next is the recorded conversations, XXXX States she reviewed these conversations, yet couldnt find the most important ones, and then the Next Representative, XXXX, Lies and tells me they dont save anything after 7 years, Right after XXXX admits to listening to them, But still the most important 3 conversations that would prove that the loan services was Not done appropriately, nor correctly at all. 
The most important call I made to them, was with XXXX XXXX, Who I asked if I could mail them a Cashiers Check for the {$9000.00}, apply to my loan and just put me back in good status, and XXXX XXXX exact response was Im Sorry Wells Fargo Does Not want to do anything for me This right here easily, and clearly shows all Wells Fargo wanted is my Home and the {$80000.00} in Equity. 
Very odd how this conversation couldnt be found, Again Proves their Fraudulent Actions. 
The other 2 Were XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. 
Also, XXXX XXXX XXXX the first lawyer I hired, who was on channel 2 News with XXXX XXXX, He was telling the public what the financial institutes were doing and stated for people to get an attorney. 
I hired him, and amazingly in just 30 days, he contact the judge asking to be removed from my case Why would this be. Because Wells Fargo Threaten him, or Paid him off to step aside. And after 3 years My 2nd Attorney, XXXX XXXX had suddenly just vanished. 
Very easy to see what happened here, Wells Fargo paid for the justice they needed. 
Again, For Wells Fargo to be convicted and found guilty of 11 Federal Felonies, and Not one person went to prison for these crimes. You ask yourself why is that, and Its because Wells Fargo has the money to afford any justice they want."
4/24/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/2022, I encountered an issue with a double charge for my wedding photography payment of {$880.00} in XXXX with my Wells Fargo Visa credit card. After noticing two identical transactions from two different merchants, namely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX, I initiated two separate dispute inquiries with each merchant as I was unsure which one to file with. One dispute was closed immediately, with the explanation that it was a duplicated error.

However, the other dispute was also closed, stating that the merchant had provided the services for which I was billed, and that I had accepted the services. I strongly disagree with this decision, as I have not paid for the same service twice in one day, especially for wedding photography services.

I have spoken with Wells Fargo customer service and expressed my concerns, requesting the exact time that the transactions occurred. Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain a satisfactory response. While I was advised to file another dispute with the other charge, it had already been declined at the beginning of the process. 

I am deeply dissatisfied with this outcome, and I would like to file a formal complaint regarding this matter. I kindly request a thorough investigation and resolution to this issue, as I believe it is unjust and unfair. I would like the extra {$880.00} refunded.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."

Moreover Wells Fargo gave no relief to 2 charge offs on my credit report within 3 months of each other. 

Wells Fargo sent me the title to vehicle I took loan out on with no explanation or apology for what happened at their company with the false insurance.

They said it might be identity theft because they discovered that somehow someone was able to obtain my name, SSN and physical address to create a bank account at XXXX, the email address and phone number of the account at XXXX were both invalid. So people at XXXX assisted me to file disputes for both transactions, I also contacted Well Fargo about that and they also file disputes for both of them.

On that day there were numerous spam calls and messages to my computer and devices. During that time I noticed a message saying that a new XXXX payee was added to my Wells Fargo account. I quickly logged into my Wells Fargo account and saw where two ( XXXX ) XXXX transfers had been made to a XXXX XXXX, XXXX for {$1000.00} and one for {$990.00}. I dont know who this person is and did not initiate or authorize these transactions. 

I immediately called the Wells Fargo dispute line and reported the fraud. They took all my information and gave me a case number. I was told they were closing the account that was attacked and were opening up a new account to replace the old one. Remaining money from the old account was transferred to the new one. They told me to create a new username and login with a new password. I was also required to use a remote Secure ID to login. I was never required by Wells Fargo to do this before even for XXXX transfers. The XXXX transfers before were transferred almost instantly. I only had XXXX XXXX payee in my account and that was only to transfer money from my Wells Fargo account to my other bank account. 

I called daily to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and they always told me that investigations were still ongoing. On XX/XX/2023 I received a letter dated XX/XX/2023 from Wells Fargo stating that my fraud claim had been denied because they had determined that the transactions had been authorized by me. This is absolutely not the truth and is an insulting and libelous statement. It is obvious that Wells Fargo had serious flaws in their account security systems for letting this happen. Whats worse is they refuse to compensate me for the thefts from my account. 

According to my investigations these XXXX frauds have happened on many Wells Fargo accounts during the last several months. Also, these fraud transactions are covered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo is obligated to reimburse me for these fraud thefts and I will pursue all actions to insure this is done."

I was thus sent a contract with instructions on receiving a check through email to pay for equipment ( Laptop, microphone, headphones etc. ) that the company wanted me to use for this contracted voiceover job. Once I received the check of {$4400.00} on XX/XX/23 through email I was instructed to wire that check to a 3rd party individual that was supposedly going to purchase the equipment and send them to me. I wired the money that same day. However, the next day XX/XX/23 the individual I've been dealing with named XXXX XXXX asked me to do the same thing but this time for insurance on the equipment. He sent through email another {$4400.00} check. Now my suspicions were raised and I reached out to his company which was XXXX and they had never heard of him. I sent them a copy of all my email correspondences with this individual and they said he isn't from their company. After looking more closely at his email address he was using XXXX but the real website is XXXX  At that point I reached out to my bank Wells Fargo and explained the situation and started a claim that was XX/XX/23. As of today XX/XX/23 the {$4400.00} has been taken from my checking account to cover for this fraudulent wire transfer to which Wells Fargo hasn't said they will cover or not. Now I am scrambling to put money into my account to cover my mortgage and other expenses that are coming due while not knowing if Wells Fargo is going to help or not.

I personally went into my local branch yesterday at XXXX XXXX  and was treated terribly. They told me to go call the airlines and get documentation. I asked if we could call together so they could hear everything. They laughed and said no you can go call from your car. I did this leaving me no choice and of course the airline wouldn't provide me with anything unless I had a booking number which obviously I don't have since I didn't purchase anything. 

There were approximately XXXX attempts that day. Today is the XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo will not refund my money and I am overdrawn. I have escalated this case to every superior manager I can.

The ATM recorded amount as {$1400.00} instead of {$14000.00} but I didnt see therrror and approved incorrect amount. I went into the bank and explained the mistake. They told me to report it over phone to department managing ATMs. Which I did at that time.

Fraud was claimed due to me logging into to my account from abroad. It is true that I have logged into the account from abroad, however I do not believe any suspicious transactions took place. I called the phone number attached on the email but I was unable to prevent the closure of my account and told me the further verification will be required at a later date. I offered to provide more information over the call but I was told nothing could be done. Now my funds are trapped in this account with no ETA of when my account will be unfrozen. Wells Fargo says they will close my account on XXXX."
4/25/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"I have banked with Wells Fargo for over 6 years. There have been numerous times I was charged overdraft fees incorrectly. I was either charged for fees still pending and even after the funds were deposited. I have also set up my account to take from my savings so there are no overdrafts, but my bank never did that. Instead they charged me overdraft fees."

The charge in question is for {$300.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and it also included an international purchase fee of {$9.00}. 

I immediately reported this unauthorized charge and filed a claim with Wells Fargo. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called to check the status of my claim, and I was informed that it had been denied because the system detected that it was not fraud. I escalated the issue to senior management, explaining that I had never heard of the company in question, and that it was not even searchable on XXXX. Therefore, it was clear that it was a scam. I also questioned how the bank could approve an international charge without verifying it with me first. 

In addition, Wells Fargo suggested that I try calling the company to get my money back, even though it was clear that the charge was unauthorized and fraudulent. 

The response I received from Wells Fargo was unsatisfactory. They could not provide any details about the merchant or how the system determined that it was not fraud. This is unacceptable, as it is clear that the charge was unauthorized and fraudulent. 

I am requesting that Wells Fargo refund the unauthorized charge of {$300.00} and the international purchase fee of {$9.00}. I also request that the bank conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and take steps to prevent such unauthorized charges from occurring in the future. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

This Wells Fargo person had all of our personal information ; social security numbers, passwords, home address, and had already moved money between accounts to consolidate the amount stolen.

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I was told our case was denied and WF would not recover our stolen money. My account was not even set up for wire transfers, and the money went to someone XXXX dont know in a state I dont go to or know anyone. This transaction should have been flagged immediately. I can not even take more than a couple XXXX dollars from an ATM, why would they allow {$9100.00} to be instantly wired and not contact me? Wells Fargo did nothing to protect me or my money, then denied my claim and said it was my fault. As a large banking institution it was their responsibility to refund my stolen {$9100.00} and go after the thief. They have insurance to handle these fraudulent transactions but just declined my claim rather than assist a victim of theft/fraud. I was kicked when I was down by a company that should have protected me, or in the least make some effort to try."

4/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem making or receiving payments,"Summary We pay monthly fees to our condominium management association from our Wells Fargo checking account using XXXX and Bank XXXX XXXX. When our payments are sent, Wells Fargo bank prints a paper check and sends it by mail to the condominium. The condo association deposits the check into their bank account as usual. We have followed this process for years and it has always worked correctly. 

That said, our condo association recently informed us that they did not receive our payment for XX/XX/XXXX. They provided me their record of payments received, photocopies of our checks from other months before and after XXXX, and confirmed with their bank that our payment for XXXX had not been received or deposited. I have attached photocopies of the other canceled checks as examples, to show that there is a canceled paper check for each payment. I have also included a copy of our XXXX payment transaction from the Wells Fargo website. 

By all indications, the payee did not receive our check for {$750.00} and they are requesting payment. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo has deducted the funds from our account and insists that the transaction was completed. However, Wells Fargo can not produce a copy of a canceled check to support Wells Fargos claim. 

Wells Fargo has deducted {$750.00} from our account even though payment was never received by the payee. Wells Fargo must either provide proof the funds were paid to the payee or refund the amount back to our checking account. 

History XX/XX/XXXX The Bill Pay payment made in XXXX was expected to be received by this date. 
XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by the condominium management association that, after a review of their books, our payment for XX/XX/XXXX was never received. 
XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Wells Fargo employees at my local branch, asking for a copy of the canceled check. They suggested that I call the Wells Fargo XXXX support phone number. I did, and they opened a request for a copy of the check and said that it would be mailed to me soon. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a message from Wells Fargo in XXXXXXXX XXXX Messages saying that my payment was processed as requested. Wells Fargo did not send the promised copy of the canceled check or any other supporting documentation. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo and asked again for a copy of the check. The customer service representative transferred my call to a supervisor. The supervisor escalated the case to a higher level of support. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a generic email from Wells Fargo acknowledging the case was open and that they will respond within ten business days. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received another email from Wells Fargo saying they are currently reviewing the claim. 
XX/XX/XXXX After a month, Wells Fargo had still not responded. I called the contact listed in XXXX XXXX email ( XXXX, XXXX, ext. XXXX ) and left a voice mail. No one called back, so I called her again and left another voice mail. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called again and spoke to XXXX. She said is contacting XXXX, the Fraud & Claims investigatoXXXX who is working on this claim. She said XXXX will call back in XXXX hours. 
XX/XX/XXXX After three days, XXXX did not contact me. I did not have contact information for XXXX, so I call I called XXXX and left a voice mail.

Wells Fargo then conducting an investigation and concluded that the charges were not fraudulent. I was able to reach out to merchants to confirm that I either do not hold accounts with those merchants or that I did not make those charges, however Wells Fargo is still denying my claim and will not let me appeal any of the charges even the ones that I was able to verify myself that were fraudulent. 
I have spoken with their appeals team multiple times only to be denied help. The amounts total upwards of {$4100.00}. my debit card was stolen and someone has been using my card all across the state of Georgia. Wells Fargo will not refund me my money. Please help. I will attach screenshots of fraudulent charges below."
4/26/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"This is in response to Wells Fargos letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which purports to address the concerns I raised with the CFPB Complaint # XXXX against Wells Fargo pursuant to Consent Order, File No. XXXX as Im seeking remediation for the financial and emotional harm caused by Wells Fargo for its improper denial of my application for modification which has resulted in the loss of my home. 
Wells Fargos XX/XX/XXXX, letter is riddled with truths and out rights lies that I will address in the order they appear in the letter. 

Wells Fargo claims that the denial was not based on income but rather due to not meeting the NPV eligibility for the program. One of the NPV inputs is income. Wells Fargo is splitting hairs in an attempt to hoodwink the CFPB. Wells Fargo must be required to provide all of the NPV inputs it utilized as required by RESPA and HAMP, yet Wells Fargo still refuses to provide those numbers. Why, because Wells Fargo can only manufacture reasons for denial if it does not have to prove the reason for the denial. 
Clearly, Wells Fargo failed to actually read my complaint as it states in its letter the following : Weve determined when the account was reviewed for the Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) this resulted in a denial, due to not meeting net present value ( NPV ) eligibility for the program. Weve found no evidence the denial was based on income calculations. 
In my complaint I clearly stated that Wells Fargo incorrectly calculated my PITI as {$980.00}. I NEVER stated the denial was due to income calculations. Wells Fargo has failed to address this very specific concern of Wells Fargos inability to properly calculate principal, interest, taxes and insurance. As one of the largest servicers in the country one would think that Wells Fargo would know how to calculate simple math that involves addition and subtraction, this is not a physics equation. 
I was paying my own taxes and insurance payments and the loan was an interest only loan. The {$980.00} was the interest payment not the complete PITI payment. 
Wells Fargo claimed that I could afford my current payment because my DTI was 22 %. Again, that statement is false as Wells Fargo only considered my monthly interest only payment of {$980.00}. My DTI was in fact 38 % with just the interest only payment and escrow and would have been much higher once the principal payment was added. Wells Fargo stated in its XX/XX/XXXX, letter that it found no evidence the denial was based on income calculations. This statement is false as Wells Fargo claimed I could afford my current payment because the DTI was 22 % thereby issuing a denial based upon my income. See attached LMT Process Notes dated XXXX ( Exhibit A1 and A2 ) wherein WF calculates the total mortgage payment, PITI, as {$980.00}. {$980.00} is the monthly interest only payment. Wells Fargo continues with this error in calculating PITI in XX/XX/XXXX, see attached LMT Process Notes. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo is still using {$980.00} as the XXXX and XXXX payment when it represents the interest only payment. See attached email string from XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. ( Exhibit B ). This email also reflects the additional $ XXXX added to the principal with no explanation as to what that additional amount represents. 
Wells Fargos claim in its XX/XX/XXXX, that the denial for HAMP was not based on income is false based on Wells Fargos denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, ( Exhibit C ), a letter that Wells Fargo failed to provide to the CFPB in its effort obfuscate the truth. The XX/XX/XXXX, letter states You have not been approved for a mortgage loan modification because we were unable to get you to a modified payment amount that you could afford per the investor guidelines on your mortgage. Wells Fargo is stating that I am denied because I could not afford the mortgage payment. Obviously, affordability is based on income. 
Attached is Wells Fargos letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, wherein Wells Fargo employee XXXX XXXX states that there are two reasons I was denied a HAMP modification. First, the loan to value of the property or the appraised value was less than the outstanding balance of my loan. The appraised value of my property as of XX/XX/XXXX, was {$390000.00}, which is clearly more than the amount due of {$200000.00}. Wells Fargo had a valuation of {$420000.00}. See Exhibits E1 and E2. The LTV is under 60 %. The 2nd reason for the denial is because your debt-to-income ratio was at 31.01 %. This means the reason for my denial was based on income despite Wells Fargos claim it was not. The debt-to-income ratio was incorrectly calculated as Wells Fargo only used the interest only payment as opposed to the total PITI. Therefore, the XX/XX/XXXX, denial is bogus based on flawed data that Wells Fargo utilized to my determent. 
XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, letter ( Exhibit F ) is a denial based upon my income. Wells Fargo claims I was not approved because we were unable to get you to a modified payment amount that you could afford per the investor guidelines. Affordability is based on income. Wells Fargo has also refused to produce the investor guidelines it claims it so relied nor has Wells Fargo produced the NPV inputs it utilized to reach this decision. 
XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, letter ( Exhibit G ) states that after a thorough review of the financial information provided, we are unable to offer you a loan modification at this time. The denial is clearly based on income. This letter also references the Agreement wherein I was to make three monthly installments of {$490.00} each with a fourth payment of {$17000.00}. Wells Fargo had my financials and therefore clearly knew that I did not have {$17000.00} to make that 4th payment. Wells Fargo was setting me up for failure. However, pursuant to the LMT Process Notes dated XXXX, ( Exhibit H ( ), Wells Fargo states that it can not set me up in a 4-month plan of {$1500.00} month because the borrower can not be put in a plan they do not show the ability to afford. Wells Fargo seems to be concerned at a monthly {$1500.00} payment ; however, it has no qualms in setting me up to fail with a {$17000.00} payment. 
Wells Fargo knew what my actual monthly payment was including escrow as I had a conversation with XXXX at Wells Fargo on XXXX  ( Exhibit see page 23 -34 transcript ) who acknowledged that when the escrow was added to my payment the total payment was {$2100.00}. XXXX stated to me regarding the escrow I mean, you know, this isnt something for them to realize ; but, you know, and what they offered you, because it sounds like there was some confusion in what they said and what they sent and everything else. XXXX went on to acknowledge that XXXX XXXX offered me a step rate modification. However, the reality is that despite the fact XXXX XXXX approved me for a loan modification, Wells Fargo failed to make that offer to me. 
I issued two, very detailed letters, to Wells Fargo, dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Both are attached. My frustration is clear that in that Wells Fargo refuses to explain how it arrived at the amount it claims I owe. I would not/will not enter into an agreement to repay an amount that can not be substantiated as owed. 
Wells Fargo attached to its XXXX XXXX XXXX, letter two opportunities for me to modify my loan. I have already addressed the XX/XX/XXXX, payment plan that included a balloon payment of {$17000.00}. The letters I attached dated XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, detail the issues I was having and why the XX/XX/XXXX loan modification was questioned. ( Exhibit XXXX and XXXX ). 
The XX/XX/XXXX, loan modification increases the principal amount owed by {$23000.00}. I questioned how Wells Fargo arrived at that number but Wells Fargo was not able to do so. ( Exhibit K ). The XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo letter reflects a total delinquency as of XX/XX/XXXX, as {$12.00}, XXXX. Why is Wells Fargo claiming one month later that the delinquency amount I owe has decreased by {$10000.00}? ( Exhibit L ). Wells Fargos job as servicer is to account for amounts owed and amounts paid, and Wells Fargo has demonstrated that it is unable to do that effectively and correctly. Is Wells Fargo smarter than a 4th grader, I think not. 
Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure action against me on XXXX XXXX XXXX I fought Wells Fargo for 10 years in the Court system. I paid well over {$80000.00} in attorney fees and costs to fight Wells Fargo. However, due to a technicality, the merits of my case were never adjudicated by the Court. Wells Fargo never had to answer for the fact that it improperly denied me for a loan modification because Wells Fargo failed to add my monthly escrow payment to my interest only payment. The numbers do not lie, its only Wells Fargo that lies. In addition to the legal fees, I have incurred {$10000.00} medical fees and costs in my effort to obtain help for my mental health as a result of losing my home when I know that Wells Fargo improperly denied my application for modification. And, the fact XXXX XXXX approved me for a loan modification which Wells Fargo failed to make that offer to me. I also have the loss of my home to an illegal foreclosure. The value of my home is {$350000.00} ( XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX ) and I estimate I have lost over {$140000.00} in equity. 
Wells Fargo failed to properly evaluate me for loan modification which is an abusive act as defined by the CFPB. Wells Fargo leveraged certain circumstances to take an unreasonable advantage of me by lying as to the reason for the denial and based on its own records, that reason for the denial is a lie. Wells Fargo deceived me and XXXX XXXX by failing to use the correct number as to my PITI payment by using only the interest only payment I was making. Wells Fargo deceived me with ever changing numbers as to the amount I owed, and its employees could not answer the simple question as to how Wells Fargo arrived at these amounts. Wells Fargo impeded my ability to understand the reason for the denial for HAMP by failing to provide to me the NPV data inputs and to claim the reason for the denial was not based on income when every denial letter states the opposite. If Wells Fargo did not obscure, withhold or hide information from me such as the NPV inputs, I could have advised Wells Fargo back in XXXX it was using the wrong number for my current PITI payment as the payment it utilized with the interest only payment that did not include principal, taxes or insurance. Wells Fargo, to date, has failed to acknowledge that it made this mistake costing me my home and, to be honest, forced me to endure over a decade of incredible emotional stress and financial hardship. 

Wells Fargo needs to be held responsible for its lies, deceit and failure to do its job as a servicer of a federally backed loan. And to comply with orders of remediation for their conduct under the terms of the Consent Order Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any additional information."

I attempted to work with Wells Fargo by producing 10 packets through XXXX and was denied a new loan, I used a local housing counseling program as requested, and tried mediation. I received a letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the property did not qualify for a HAMP loan because it was "" a three unit, investment property. '' The property is NOT an investment property, I called immediately and left a message ; it was a home on 1.69 acres ; I had no idea where the idea it was an investment property came from. I received a letter of apology from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX stating that their previous letter of XX/XX/XXXX incorrectly referred to as a "" three unit, investment property. Per the original loan application, our records indicate that the loan was originated for a single owner occupied property. '' "" WFHM regrets any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused you. '' The letter stated my loan "" is in review ''. Once I received the HAMP loan the mortgage jumped from {$290000.00} ( XXXX ) to over {$350000.00} ( XXXX ) and WFHM refused to negotiate to forgive or allowed for their error involving their mismanagement and misinformation of the property. I believe the hardship of 3 years plus they unwillingness to forgive any of the penalties and interest qualifies for the pay out being offered. The loan was also supposed to be in my name only and yet to this day they have not taken my former husband ( now deceased as of XX/XX/XXXX ) off the loan as promised. I signed the paperwork for the HAMP alone and he was not part of the HAMP loan as we were divorced and he did not fill out any of the 10 packets. Why is the loan still in both our names when only I applied? WFHM informed me ( in XXXX ) that to take his name off required another re-finance that I felt was too costly ( I was quoted between {$40000.00} to {$50000.00} )."

4/27/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Problem with fees charged,As I'm attempting to pay down my car loan I've noticed that there's no way to apply an extra payment to principal only. Wells Fargo continues to apply this to interest and fees. I am currently 3 months ahead on my payments and no matter what when I apply an extra payment it continues to apply a certain amount to the interest despite being ahead. The only way to apply additional payments to principal is to add it on to an automatic pay option. There are even fees that are being paid that I don't understand or can not tell what they are. I'm not certain why I have to pay future interest that hasn't yet occurred. For example if I pay off my car now then I would have paid interest that never would have existed increasing the overall cost of the car.
4/27/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Wells Fargo has fraudulently and unethically changed the Terms of my Mortgage. During the pandemic I legally took advantage of the Cares Act and did not make any payments for 16 months. During this time it was verbally agreed between myself and Wells Fargo that the 16 months would simply be put at the end of the loan. Which I had no problem with. I had already paid 8 years into my original 30 year loan. Unbeknownst to me, they changed it to a 40 year loan!! And have restarted collecting a whole new amount of interest. My previous payment applied {$260.00} to my Principle balance. Now, only {$130.00} is applied to my Principle. At the time of Loan Modification was to start after the Cares Act ended, a Notary Public came to my house with a stack of Papers to sign, which I did. But it was NEVER pointed out to me that the loan was now a 40 year loan! It was not talked about and was sneakily placed into the paperwork. I have a pdf copy of the agreement, but it is probably too large a file to add here. I can email it to someone when needed."

I wrote checks for the exact amounts needed from my personal Wells Fargo account to keep the business account from going negative. My personal account at Wells Fargo has a Line of Credit attached to the account to cover any overdrafts should they occur. However, before the overdrafts occurred my business had an influx of deposits so on XXXX I wrote checks back to the Wells Fargo Account for the exact amounts to cover the checks to avoid any potential overdrafts. Because of this, I ended up NOT having to use the Wells Fargo Line of Credit. My Wells Fargo account currently has a positive balance, but today I was sent an email without warning or explanation that they are closing my accounts. Ive tried to contact someone who has any insight so I can explain the situation but havent been able to discuss this issue with anyone.

4/27/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I've discovered that over the previous 2 months, my XXXX XXXX through Wells Fargo has charged 2 bogus interest charges & 1 bogus late fee. I just spent one hour on the phone with Wells Fargo to discuss, and I'm extremely dissatisfied with how it was handled, and I have reason to suspect this may be another institutional fraudulent activity that Wells Fargo may be undertaking. Essentially, Wells Fargo appears to be trying to steal from me by charging interest at the DAY the billing cycle ends, instead of the payment due date the following month. Here is the situation : 1st : billing cycle from XXXX I paid my balance in full XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, for a bill with a payment due date of XX/XX/XXXX. I got charged interest onXX/XX/XXXX of {$74.00}. Interest was charged for the month, EVEN THOUGH the bill wasn't due until XX/XX/XXXX, AND totally ignoring the fact that I paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX ( and paid in full every month prior ). This bill shows an interest charge of {$74.00} on a balance of {$0.00}. What's incredibly disturbing about this is that, after investigation, the person I spoke with said the interest was charged on an amount of ~ {$3500.00}, and that doesn't tie to ANY balance from the month. It seems abundantly clear they charged an arbitrary amount to my account. 

2nd : billing cycle from XXXX : I didn't pay off this card early, so the ending balance for the month should be {$4400.00}. Instead, the balance includes {$74.00} from the bogus interest charge in the prior month, a late fee of {$29.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for failure to pay my interest charge from the prior month, and a NEW interest charge of {$93.00} charge onXX/XX/XXXXXXXX the DAY the billing cycle ends, even though the bill clearly shows that payment is due onXX/XX/XXXX. And once again, the interest charge was calculated on a bogus arbitrary amount that doesn't tie to ANY balance at any point of the month, The first rep I spoke to kept trying to educate me that interest is charged when payment is late, but refused to understand the situation that was taking place. After escalating ( though refusing to do so at first ), the next person I spoke with at least seemed to understand the situation with the bogus interest charges, but spent some time refusing to escalate a reversal of my late fee, which was assessed for not paying a bogus interest charge. Currently, this situation is under review with a "" conflict resolution specialist '' and I am not hopeful at all that this will get resolved. I'm so upset that they are clearly trying to rob me, and the folks I spoke with were unable to give me a reasonable explanation of the charges at all."
4/27/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/2022 we were alerted by another business that they had not received our payment made weeks before. Upon reviewing, it appeared that the check was cashed by an individual nameed "" XXXX  '' and through some other third party cashing facility. The check was just under {$5000.00} and was a company check made to another company. We have been waiting since for Wells Fargo to credit this amount back to our account. We put the claim in on XX/XX/2022, the same day we learned of the issue, Then on the XXXX of XXXX, we received Wells Fargo 's request for us to complete an affidavit. We did on that following work week XX/XX/XXXX and put it in the mail immediately. Wells Fargo stated in writing that we had 20 days to complete, we did so very timely, but they then closed our claim, saying they had not received the affidavit within the allotted time. When I called to check on the status, I learned this and also that they did notate the account that the affidavit came in that afternoon, just about an hour after they closed the claim. They reopened the claim and now have given the third party institution 120 days to respond. Clearly this is an unfair business practice. They allow the owner of the account just 20 days to respond yet they allow the third party institution 120 days to respond. It is a XXXX - XXXX advantage against the consumer and owner of the account. I believe this is gross negligence on their part and an attempt to benefit one party over the other. All of this is in writing and can be verified. On top of it all, when I call to request resolution, time and time again, no one calls me back or they disconnect me or they transfer my call to a "" foreign language line ''. There is no justification for allowing one party to take 120 days to review and respond when the check was clearly cashed fraudulently. Anyone who understands banking knows that proper identification would be required before cashing a business check. When we opened the account more than a decade ago, it was made clear that we ( even as owners ) would have to provide identification in order to cash any check we brought into the bank. We can deposit it only into our business account but would need identification to withdraw the money."
4/27/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,These people who are answering my complaint at wells fargo are liars. There is evidence XXXX XXXX lied about me that I harassed her while I was at the bank opening up my new account that they wrongfully closed. I don't care that they have a right to close it. They were doing that with my first account which I had open at the wells fargo branch on XXXX in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I am tired of being treated like this. I did nothing wrong I have never harassed XXXX XXXX. This is just another tactic for XXXX XXXX to enrage me about. Like everything else they have enrage me. Anyone has flat out refused to listen to my side of the story. It was personal why my checking account was closed. I don't care what anyone says. Wells fargo even admitted to it was because of XXXX XXXX said I harassed her. I have never harassed XXXX XXXX. She slandered me which caused me to lose my checking account
4/27/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,"A Wells Fargo employee got an attitude with me and closed my account. After I did nothing wrong. 

She asked me a couple questions, the same questions that I was asked earlier on the call. I gave my social and date of birth and she then proceeded to close my account. 

Wells Fargo has not trained this employee correctly or she is acting on her own and closing accounts because she is not having a good day at work. 

Wells Fargo is discriminating against me for being XXXX which is federally illegal. The employee also had the option to send a 6 digit code to my phone to verify my but chose not to- which is discriminatory behavior. They closed my account for absolutely no reason."
4/27/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Good afternoon, Id like to state that this is the wrong section. My intended form to file was for filing a complaint with debit card chargebacks. I failed to find it. I hope you can re-arrange it in the system. 

With that out of the way, Ill start by stating the elephant in the room. 
This goes out to Wells Fargo Bank AND XXXX. 

The story is, I bought two identical cameras from XXXX. The "" XXXX XXXX '' the reason for getting two of them is for my cooking channel on XXXX. After some time I realized I could just use one of them and save money by returning the other one. 

Alright, cool so I return one of the cameras to the seller ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and keep the one that was sold directly by XXXX. To reiterate, the seller I listed above is an independent seller on the XXXX marketplace. 

So, them being Identical cameras I accidentally shipped the wrong one to them, the only difference being the serial numbers. 
You can not blame me, it was an honest mistake they are once again exactly identical models. 

So, weeks go by without a refund and I contact the seller ( XXXX XXXX ) and ask what happened with my refund. They tell me I returned a camera with a different serial number. I tell them my apologies and that I'll send the correct one over but in return, I want the one I shipped to them back and a refund as Ill be shipping the correct one. In return Ill cover shipping. 

They agree, so I pay for shipping to send the correct one back while they still have my other camera ( once again both are XXXX XXXX 's ) in their possession. I check the tracking daily like a hawk, till it said delivered finally! 

I ask them what happened with the refund and shipping my other camera over as it said delivered+signed on the tracking. They said they never got it. That they will investigate, find out what happened, and get back to me. 

This went on for months back and forth telling me they will investigate and that they found nothing in their warehouse. With nothing ever coming out of it! 

They refused to send me the wrongly returned camera, even though they sent me the serial of it showing they had it. They also kept acting like they never got the correctly returned camera when tracking info showed delivered and signed by there warehouse. 

It seems like they made quite a profit that day! Not only did they have my money ( approximately {$1300.00} ), but they also got to keep an identical camera for free, in addition to the one they sold me. 

Why were they able to get away with this without any consequences, such as me being able to file an A-Z claim or report the seller to XXXX for engaging in clearly illicit activities? 

Well, unfortunately, things couldn't get any worse, as my account on XXXX was closed around the same time this ordeal was happening. Closed for "" too many returns ''. This was a long-standing account that we had opened since 2014, with thousands of purchases made over the years. With a big family, returns were bound to happen, but we always returned items in their original condition and shipped them promptly. It's really disappointing that XXXX treated us this way. 

Anyways, this seller knew they could do all this without any consequences as I had no one to go to. 

At some point, I reached my breaking point and threatened the seller with legal action and complaints to every bureau I could think of. Eventually, they gave in and returned the camera they had been holding hostage. However, they never refunded me for the original camera I had returned, which means they made a profit without losing any inventory. At this point, I realized that I would probably be going back and forth with them for months again, so I decided to file a chargeback with my bank and move on. 

So, I call Wells Fargo to tell them I want to file a dispute. I explicitly told the agent, the reason for dispute is I returned something, have the tracking, and never got a refund. He said "" Ok, all set ''. Without ever asking for the tracking or further documentation and told me to have a nice day. Thought it was pretty fast and easy and went on with my day. 

Until... recently I got a letter from Wells Fargo saying they reversed the claim because "" we found the charges were made by you or someone who had your permission '' WHAT?!? I never filed a claim saying my card got stolen or that this was an unauthorized charge! I clearly stated I wanted to file a dispute for shipping an item and never getting a refund! 

Unbelievable, so I call their claims department and am on hold for several hours. Finally, I get to a rep for them to tell me they cant help me as it's already final. The rep also states the documentation the XXXX seller provided. She stated the seller said I returned a totally different camera and made a dispute. 

On top of everything else, these people had the audacity to lie in the documentation to make it look like I was the one at fault. It was infuriating, especially since they were able to provide documentation while I couldn't. I repeatedly expressed my frustration to the representative, but she simply apologized and said that the case had been finalized, and suggested that I reach out to XXXX for help. I knew it would be a dead end with Wells Fargo and XXXX, so I hung up in frustration. Sitting here regretting trying to settle things with the seller and realized that it would have been easier to just resell the camera for a refund. 

Now knowing XXXX won't help me, and nor will my bank, I come here. I'm ~ {$1300.00} in the hole with no one to help. It started off as an honest mistake but Im clearly in the right here... 

To reiterate I shipped a camera with a different serial number yet it was the identical camera/model ( only difference is the serial ), saw my mistake, agreed to arrangement to ship the correct one back and get the wrong one back while also getting a refund for shipping the correct one back if I cover shipping. 

P.S I would like to mention since this problem has been going on since XXXX of last year, the tracking no longer works. As XXXX discards tracking numbers older then 120 days. Luckily for me, I have proof of receipt from XXXX. Also I am confident, if these companies decide to take my claims seriously they can contact XXXX and get them to use their internal systems to verify the tracking number. 


DOCUMENTATION : Some proof I cant get as its in my XXXX account which is now long gone, I still have some in my email though. So if anything is missing context, thats why. 

Also, these are not in chronological order. Im sorry for whoever is reviewing this, if I could I would. 

I will provide evidence, but I will also explain it. 

1. This screenshot is me contacting XXXX in regard to this situation. The tracking shown in this photo is for the camera that was correctly returned. This is after me and the seller made arrangements, yet they kept taking too long. 
The rep decided to file an A-Z claim and I backed up the seller! Knowing how detrimental A-Z claims are to a seller 's reputation I declined! Thinking the seller would help me without issue. After the chat, I contacted XXXX again to cancel the claim... 

2. Refer to 1.

3. refer to 1. 

4-4c. Proof that this was for the correct camera returned. 

5. Proof that this has been going on since XXXX. 

6. My first contact with XXXX after they closed my account. They closed it after I stated to a chat rep that I never got a refund for something that shows "" delivered ''. This is for the camera I wrongly returned. This is before I had found out it was the identical camera I returned yet a different serial via the seller. 

6a-6b. email reply to XXXX with tracking. You can tell this is for the wrong camera shipped as it shows the recipient for a "" return dock '' rather than an actual address, like the seller provided. 

7. Seller agreeing to arrangment, I return the correct camera back, they ship back my the wrong one, and they issue a refund as long as I pay shipping. 

8. Seller first time informing me that the camera I returned was the wrong one which is the reason I never got a refund this whole time. Also showing proof they had the wrong one in there possesion/hostage till several months later. 

9. Now XXXX, them acting clueless and still having both cameras in possesions up till this point. 

10. Heres them not replying to me for 10 days after promising to help me. And me showing that I even backed them up to be treated like this. 

11. More generic responses and wasting time. 

12. Them replying to me 14 days later saying they cant find the package. Then trying to pin me on the weight of the package when it was just because I didn't ship back some attachments that came included. 

12a. My reply 13. Them saying they cant help me at all.

14. XXXX XXXX REFUSING to not only refund my money that they kept while also keeping there original camera! But also holding the camera that I sent to them hostage! 

14a. Me getting fed up with them 15. There response to 14a 15a. This here is what I replied but is important info as it shows the exact info that was shown on the tracking number before it was disposed for being older then 120 days. And also once again our agreement. 

XXXX6. Them finally releasing my camera hostage with my response included. Which they never replied to! Just acted like it wasnt there. After this, I promptly started a chargeback with my bank for once again the correct camera I shipped back and never got a refund for."

This puts Wells Fargo in many violations of HAMP and shows they did not negotiate in good faith under CPLR 3408 ( f ). Wells Fargo continued the modification process even after the excuse of Investor does not participate for a Traditional inhouse Modification and strangely got denied again in XXXX XXXX based on again the 42 % denial. Again, this shows Wells Fargo did not negotiate in good faith under CPLR 3408 ( f ). 

This complaint herein is following up my XX/XX/XXXX complaint with Wells Fargos XX/XX/XXXX answer. On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process about my issues. Wells Fargo had me participate in the CPLR 3408 Mandatory Settlement Conference from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted my 1st modification documents by XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo Responded in XX/XX/XXXX that my modification was denied due to, your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income. My Attorney argued that their numbers were incorrect that my monthly income was 30 % and within HAMP guidelines and asked Wells Fargo to recalculate, but was denied again for the same reason. Denied due to Wells Fargos Software Error. 

Wells Fargos contention of my complaint is 1 ) Your HAMP denial was due to your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income. Using Wells Fargo NPV Document, they sent to my Attorney ( attached to this complaint ) proves my monthly income is 30 % of my modified payment and qualifies under HAMP. Wells Fargo using 42 % when it is actually 30 % shows Wells Fargo Software Error in calculations. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process, for the document they used showing how they came about the 42 % but they did not provide any in their XX/XX/XXXX XXXX denial letter to me. 2 ) your investor did not participate in HAMP, yet Wells Fargo has provided no Proof of that. On XX/XX/XXXX I asked XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process, for a copy of the Investors PSA showing any restrictions, but they have not provided one in their XX/XX/XXXX XXXX denial letter to me. HAMP Guidelines - The Servicers should know at the time of the identification of potential candidates for the HAMP programs the eligibility qualification of the candidates based upon the servicing agreement between the Servicer and the Investor, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ). This is also a mandate of the Making Homes Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages. Wells Fargo States 3 ) Wells Fargo is not able to provide a program or assistance option your investor does not participate in. Under Section 1.3 HAMP Guidelines Wells Fargo in writing MUST request from the Investor a Waiver of the Restrictions. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested from Wells Fargo a copy of the written request to the Investor for a waiver but they failed to provide one in their XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  denial letter to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargos answer to my complaint filed XX/XX/XXXX stating, The proposed HAMP modification payment was used only as reference for the HAMP program and was not an offer. I never claimed it was an offer, It was a Proposed HAMP Modification. Wells Fargo submitted to my attorney Proposed HAMP Modification in their Net Present Value ( NPV ) Document ( attached here to this complaint ) around XXXX XXXX. The Proposed HAMP Modification is 43 lines of different inputs all relating to me. Wells Fargo sent a proposed modification Clearly shows it was being used for modification purposes. If this document was not an actual proposed modification, what was Wells Fargo using to come up with Your HAMP denial was due to your MODIFIED PAYMENT AMOUNT would be more than 42 % of your monthly income? For Wells Fargo to State this was only a Proposed HAMP modification and not an offer is Disingenuous in that under the HAMP Guidelines it uses the NPV to determine if a proposed mortgage qualifies. Per HAMP Guidlines - In HAMP, value-enhancing modifications are identified using the Net Present Value ( NPV ) model. The NPV Model compares the expected discounted cash flows associated with the modification of a loan. The Proposed Modification, HAMP uses the Net Present Value ( NPV ) Document Wells Fargo provided to me. 

Using numbers Wells Fargo Provided to me in a Proposed HAMP Modification Wells Fargo had my Monthly income at {$6800.00}, a proposed modification of Principal and interest of {$1300.00}, monthly taxes {$640.00} and Hazzard Insurance of {$130.00}. Using Wells Fargos Proposed HAMP Modification in their Net Present Value Document the monthly mortgage total ( mtg +Taxes + Ins ) = {$2100.00} divided by Wells Fargos provided monthly income {$6800.00} = 30 % modified payment not Wells Fargos claimed 42 %. My monthly income was 30 % well within the HAMP Guidelines. 
I submitted my second Modification request in XX/XX/XXXX where my income substantially increased adding about {$2000.00} to my monthly income average. This time in XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Denied me based on your investor did not participate in HAMP. I have documentation of Wells Fargos Attorney who Wells Fargo list as Mediation Counsel through Wells Fargo, specifically requested investor to reconsider their HAMP denial but was denied again. Wells Fargos own Mediation Counsel believed I qualified.

Wells Fargo had me participate in the Mandatory Settlement Conference from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX when their investor did not participate in HAMP? Wells Fargo became the servicer of the Investor in XX/XX/XXXX, yet for over 2 years they did not know their investor participated in HAMP?

HAMP Guidelines - 1.3 Investor Solicitation - Within 90 days of executing a SPA, the servicer MUST review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP.

According to Section 1.3 of HAMP Wells Fargo became the Investors Servicer in XX/XX/XXXX so they should had determined the Investors participation by XX/XX/XXXX over 2 years Prior to my CPLR 3408 Modification. Also, the Servicer as a MANDATE potential candidates for the XXXX programs the eligibility qualification of the candidates based upon the servicing agreement between the Servicer and the Investor pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ). Here Wells Fargo Failing to abided by HAMP statues and Mandates. 

Accordin

g to HAMP guidelines The Servicers should know at the time of the identification of potential candidates for the HAMP programs the eligibility qualification of the candidates based upon the servicing agreement between the Servicer and the Investor, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ). THIS IS ALSO A MANDATE of the Making Homes Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages. According to HAMP guidelines Failing to provide a waiver of the investors restrictions demonstrates a failure to follow the HAMP guidelines which constitute a failure to negotiate in Good Faith pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ).

Per HAMP Guidelines Within 30 days of identifying an investor as a nonparticipant, or as unwilling to extend its participation in MHA to include any extension or expansion of an MHA program, or identifying a servicing agreement that limits or prohibits a servicer from offering any assistance available under MHA, including HAMP Tier 2 modifications ( i.e., prohibition against modification of non-owner occupied mortgages or limits on multiple modification of the same mortgage ), the servicer Must contact the investor in writing at least once, encouraging the investor to permit modifications and other assistance available under the extended and expanded MHA programs. Servicers, within 120 days of signing the PSA, must create and maintain in their records an Investor Participation List containing the following information : ( 2 ) a list of those investors who do not participate in HAMP. 

In Wells Fargos answer here on XX/XX/XXXX to my XX/XX/XXXX complaint, states ; Wells Fargo is not able to provide a program or assistance option your investor does not participate in. Then Why did Wells Fargo have me for 15 months, wasting money paying attorneys during this time period, have me submit 3 modifications? Why not after the first modification denial XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo did not notify me of investors participation but incorrectly deny me based on my income was 42 % and not in HAMP guidelines? When actually proven in Wells Fargos NPV Document attached to this complaint, shows Im at 30 % and Within HAMP Guidelines. Due to Wells Fargos Software Error, they incorrectly denied me. Why when I submitted my 2nd Modification where I show over {$2000.00} a month average increase in my income did Wells Fargo deny me in XX/XX/XXXX based on Investors participation? Wells Fargo states here, Wells Fargo is not able to provide a program or assistance option your investor does not participate in, why after my denial in XXXX XXXX that investor does not participate did Wells Fargo continue to have me reapply for a Modification? Wells Fargo had me apply for a Traditional in House modification in XX/XX/XXXX and getting denied again in XX/XX/XXXX due to your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income. If Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo is not able to provide a program or assistance option your investor does not participate in, why did Wells Fargo continue this charade? 

All Wells Fargo accomplished in the CPLR 3408 from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and after I got the Investors Denial of not participating in HAMP, not after my first submitted modification but after my second submitted modification is run up in principal and interest, fees and attorney cost into the total owed in the mortgage making it impossible to seek outside modification. Wells Fargo actually after the XX/XX/XXXX denial continued a Traditional inhouse Modification and was denied in about XX/XX/XXXX for the same reason Your HAMP denial was due to your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income. Why did Wells Fargo continue the HAMP modifications with me after the investor said they did not participate? 15 months of principal and interest, fees, attorney fees being added to my Mortgage Balance making it impossible for me to seek outside modification. In addition to me paying my attorney their fees for about 15 months. Wells Fargo did not follow HAMP Guidelines, Wells Fargo miscalculated my monthly income ratio per HAMP Guidelines due to a Software error. Wells Fargo Failed to Negotiate in Good Faith per CPLR 3408 ( f ). 
In my conversation on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process after she tried to justify the Denial based on the Investors Guidelines. I asked her if Wells Fargo asked the Investor for a waiver but she did not know. As I mentioned above the servicer Must contact the investor in writing at least once, encouraging the investor to permit modifications and other assistance available under the extended and expanded MHA programs Per HAMP Guidelines 1.3. 

Appellate XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX XXXX XXXX v XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Among other things, a failure "" [ to follow ] HAMP regulations and guidelines... constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ) '' ( see U.S. Bank N.A. v Smith, 123 AD3d at 917 ; cf. HSBC Bank USA, N.A. v Sadeque-Iqbal , 177 AD3d 598, 600 ). 
I requested from XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process Under HAMP if denied a modification, I can Request a copy of the Waiver of investors restrictions that should be in the loan file. I also requested a Copy of the PSA ( Pooling and Servicing Agreements ) under RESPA for my review of the Investors Restrictions. Not only in my conversation but here also I am requesting the Waiver of investors restrictions that should be in the loan file and a Copy of the PSA ( Pooling and Servicing Agreements ) under RESPA for my review.

Also, under Section 6.5 of HAMP provides that "" [ i ] f [ a ] servicer is subject to restrictions that make it unfeasible to complete the modification waterfall steps, '' the servicer Must maintain evidence showing "" that the servicer made a reasonable effort to seek a waiver from the investor and whether that waiver was approved or denied '' ( Making Home Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages, version 4.4, ch 2, 6.5 at 117 [ XX/XX/XXXX ]. Im asking Wells Fargo for a copy of the waiver if Wells Fargo asked the investor to reconsider the restrictions. 
CFPB final rules on mortgage loan servicing on XX/XX/XXXX - New national standards, changes to Regulation Z, Truth in Lending Act, and Regulation X, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. 

Servicing Policies, Procedures and Requirements - Servicers, must establish and maintain policies and procedures- Provide accurate and timely information to borrowers, investors, courts. 
Properly evaluate loss mitigation applications per investor guidelines. 
Wells Fargo in Violation of Section 1.3 of the Making Homes Affordable Program either did not comply under this section or unjustly had me apply for Mortgage Modification 2 times ( nearly 1 year ) before informing me of the Investors restrictions. After Wells Fargo notified me of the Investors restrictions in XXXX, Wells Fargo continued to have me apply for a Traditional inhouse modification into XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargos actions here for about 15 months added principal, interest, fees and attorney cost to the total owed making it impossible for me to seek outside financing. Also, my cost of paying attorney for 15 months. 

I have many Court Cases Where XXXX XXXX has offered modifications and some with Wells Fargo as Servicer. I have through an SEC Filing, XXXX XXXX for HSI Assets that they do offer Modifications. The Trust that XXXX is the Trustee of is the HSI ASSET SECURITIZATION CORP. TRUST XXXX-HE2. The following is from the SEC Filing Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as Trustee.

SEC Filing by XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX signed by Wells Fargo Executive Vice President XXXX XXXX XXXX stating under Servicing Criteria Loss mitigation or recovery actions modifications. 

It is clear Wells Fargo, 1 ) did not calculate my monthly income CORRECTLY DUE TO A Software Error to the proposed modification ( NVP ) saying it was over 42 % but was 30 % within HAMP Guidelines. 2 ) After I show my income increase by over {$2000.00} per month in XXXX  in my second modification, it now gets denied due to Investor does not participate and Wells Fargo has failed to provided any documentation of this. 3 ) Wells Fargo did not negotiate in good faith by offering me a Modification and taking 2 modification submittals till investor denied and then continued with me for an additional 5-6 months for a modification into XXXX. 4 ) Wells Fargo did not Negotiate in Good Faith by having me go through 15 months on Modification Negotiations even after Investor said did not participate. 5 ) XX/XX/XXXX Submitting my 3rd modification and already showing my income is less than 30 % of HAMP guidelines, Wells Fargo Denied me again saying my income is over 42 %. Wells Fargo Calculation Errors. 6 ) Wells Fargo made it impossible for me to get a modification on the outside market. 7 ) Wells Fargo Failed Section 1.3 of HAMP Within 90 days of executing a PSA, the servicer must review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP. 8 ) Wells Fargo failed to ask the Investor for a Waiver per section 6.5 HAMP Guidelines. 9 ) Under HAMP guidelines the servicer Must contact the investor in writing at least once, encouraging the investor to permit modifications. 10 ) Per NY XXXX XXXX Among other things, a failure "" [ to follow ] HAMP regulations and guidelines... constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ) '' Bottom line Requesting from Wells Fargo per HAMP, Wells Fargos requesting the Investor for a Waiver. Also, Requesting per RESPA a copy of Investors PSA showing Investor Restrictions.

Wells Fargo Unjustly denied me a Modification under HAMP Guidelines when I qualified at 30 % but in Wells Fargos Calculation Error got over 42 % and Did not Negotiate in Good Faith per CPLR 3408 ( f ). Not until my 2nd modification submitted showing an increase of monthly income of over {$2000.00} a month and probably even dropping Wells Fargos calculation of 42 % into HAMP guidelines did Wells Fargo come up with Investor does not participate in the program. Wells Fargo has never provided any documentation of proving this fact even though I have requested copy of PSA showing Investors restrictions. 

In my Last Complaint and in my phone conversation with XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process on XX/XX/XXXX, I requested Wells Fargo to Produce the Document with the Numbers used where they got my income was 42 % of the Mortgage, but they still have failed to provide any. Bottom line, Wells Fargo Document Net Present Value NPV attached to this complaint showing the proposed HAMP modification showing my monthly income is at 30 % of the proposed mortgage/taxes/ins monthly amount. 30 %, Well Within HAMP Guidelines and there is no Documentation of Wells Fargo Claims of investor does not participate.

Section 1.6 Compliance with Applicable Laws Each servicer and any sub-servicer that the servicer uses will be subject to and must fully comply with all federal, state, and local laws, including statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings.

Wells Fargos contention of my complaint is your investor did not participate in HAMP, yet Wells Fargo has provided no Proof of that. 

Wells Fargo States Wells Fargo is not able to provide a program or assistance option your investor does not participate in. Under Section 1.3 HAMP Guidelines Wells Fargo in writing Must request from the Investor a Waiver of the Restrictions. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested from Wells Fargo a copy of the written request to the Investor for a waiver but they failed to provide one in their XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  denial letter to me. 
HAMP Guidelines - 1 Servicer Participation in MHA - Section 1.3, participating servicers are required to use reasonable efforts to remove any prohibitions and obtain waivers or approvals from all necessary parties in order to carry out the requirements of the SPA.

In Violation of HAMP Section 1.3 Wells Fargo has failed to provide any proof they contacted the Investor and request to remove any prohibitions and obtain waivers or approvals. In my conversation on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Executive Process I requested a copy of the Waiver they asked the Investor for and on XX/XX/XXXX I received a XXXX mail from Wells Fargo stating the reason for the denial of my complaint on XX/XX/XXXX and they did not provide the Waiver I requested. 

HAMP Guidelines - 1.3 Investor Solicitation - Within 90 days of executing a SPA, the servicer MUST review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP. Within 30 days of identifying an investor as a nonparticipant, or as unwilling to extend its participation in MHA to include any extension or expansion of an MHA program, or identifying a servicing agreement that limits or prohibits a servicer from offering any assistance available under MHA, including HAMP Tier 2 modifications ( i.e., prohibition against modification of non-owner occupied mortgages or limits on multiple modification of the same mortgage ), THE SERVICER MUST CONTACT THE INVESTOR IN WRITING AT LEAST ONCE, ENCOURAGING THE INVESTOR TO PERMIT MODIFICATIONS and other assistance available under the extended and expanded MHA programs.

In Two ( 2 ) more Violation of HAMP Section 1.3 Wells Fargo failed to review and Identify the Investor as a participant in HAMP. Wells Fargo failed to contact the Investor in writing encouraging the Investor to permit Modifications. 
Section 2.2 Documentation - Servicers are required to maintain appropriate documentary evidence of their MHA-related activities. Required general documentation applicable to all MHA Programs includes but is not limited to : Evidence of assessment of investor willingness to participate in MHA programs and any specific outreach to investors or attempts to obtain waivers on either a portfolio or loan by loan basis, including copies of any contracts with investors relied upon in denying modifications. This should include, where applicable, documentation relating to specific parameters or limitations on participation required by investors for steps in the waterfall.

All documents and information related to the servicers consideration of the borrower for other loss mitigation alternatives.

6.5 Prohibitions on Modification Waterfall Steps- If the SERVICER IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT MAKE IT UNFEASIBLE TO COMPLETE THE MODIFICATION waterfall steps, the SERVICER SHOULD IDENTIFY THIS PRIOR ( PRIOR ) TO PREFORMING THE NPV EVALUATION and NOT PREFORM AN NPV EVALUATION. Servicers must maintain evidence in the loan file documenting the nature of any deviation from taking any sequential modification step in the modification waterfall and the fact that the applicable servicing agreement, investor guideline or law restricted or prohibited fully performing the modification waterfall step. The documentation must show that the servicer made a reasonable effort to seek a waiver from the investor and whether that waiver was approved or denied. 

In Violation of Section 6.5 Prohibitions on Modification, Wells Fargo did provide to me a NPV when its Investor had restrictions. I have asked Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX for a copy of the waiver Wells Fargo asked the Investor for but Wells Fargo has failed to provide one. 

Section 7 Net Present Value ( NPV ) Testing - All loans that meet the applicable HAMP eligibility criteria in Section 1 must be evaluated using a standardized NPV test that compares the NPV result for a modification to the NPV result for no modification. 
Wells Fargo filled out and presented to my Attorneys my NPV document, showing my monthly income, taxes, insurance, Principal and interest payment of the Proposed HAMP modification, a revised interest rate of 2 % and a mortgage term from 360 months to 480 months. According to HAMP Section 7 loans that meet the applicable HAMP eligibility criteria in Section 1 must be evaluated using a standardized NPV test so Wells Fargo determined that I was eligible for a HAMP Modification and in so determining went to the next step and filled out the NPV document. How can Wells Fargo determine my Qualification or fill out the NPV if the Investor does not Participate? It has already been stated in Section 1.3 that Wells Fargo should had determine investor participation in HAMP.

Continue of Section 7 Whether or not a modification is pursued, the servicer must maintain detailed documentation of the NPV model used, all NPV inputs and assumptions and the NPV results.

Again, Im asking Wells Fargo for the documents that show how they came up with your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income.

I have the Wells Fargo NPV proving using Wells Fargos numbers that I qualify at 30 % of HAMP.

Im asking Wells Fargo for the documents that show the written request ( per Section 1.3 ) of the investor for a Waiver of the restrictions.

Im asking Wells Fargo for the documents that show the Investors PSA showing the Investors Restrictions."

4/28/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Trouble during payment process,None,"I was ready to payoff my Wells Fargo XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Wells Fargo for a payoff balance and was informed that a payoff statement would be emailed to me. 
When the statement was not received after a few days, I contacted WF again on XXXX and this time the agent informed me that payoff statements must be mailed to the address they had on file. When I didn't receive a statement after 11 days, I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told it could take up to two weeks to arrive. I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX to ask for a verbal payoff amount which wind up being a phone loop from one department to another for over two hours without the desired result. I finally decided to visit a physical local branch where the rep also had a hard time reaching someone to give him the information I was looking for. He finally called me back a couple of hours later with the payoff balance and wiring instructions. I prepared the payoff funds with my bank and immediately wired the quoted payoff using the wiring instructions the rep provided The first payoff wire attempt was made on XX/XX/XXXX for the entire quoted amount. I was informed on XX/XX/XXXX by my bank that the wire was rejected due to the wrong beneficiary account information. I called back Wells Fargo again and asked for the correct wiring information and the wire was finally accepted on XX/XX/XXXX however, my HELOC balance remained unchanged as of XX/XX/XXXX. I then received a call from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX explaining due to daily intertest accruals and penalty fees the wired amount was no longer enough to cover the payoff and that I'd need an additional $ XXXX to pay off the balance. While speaking with the and referring to my online account, I observed that Wells Fargo had changed my physical home address in New Jersey to an unfamiliar address in North Carolina. This explained why I never received my payoff statement by mail XXXX weeks earlier. I explained the seriousness of security breach to the Wells Fargo agent and asked for the extra unjustified interest and penalties to be postdated and credited to my account. She informed that the issue has been escalated to her manager and that I'll be receiving a call with a resolution by the end of day. 
It is now beyond the end of the day and I'm still stuck in this crazy endless loop of trying to payoff my daily interest accruing HELOC with a bank that has a very fragmented payoff process. Either Wells Fargo is an extremely incompetent bank or they're deliberately making it difficult to payoff loans to keep their daily interest accruals and maximize profits off the backs of the hard working middle class."

4/28/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Wells Fargo has failed to respond to my previous complaint, but also revealed a clear failure, as in the information they did provide they made statements which indicate they did NOT provide complete information during the transfer of my mortgage to XXXX. 

My previous request was for WF to provide ME with copies of the information sent to XXXX, as XXXX claims it did not receive multiple pieces of infomration. WF continues to claim it sent information, but refuses to provide any proof of what was sent, only their "" assurances ''. That makes their claims as valid as my claim to be the XXXX of XXXX. 

There is no reason to refuse to provide copies of what was sent, if it fact they provided all necessary information. 

In addition to failing to provide a valid response- the documentation - WF also, in the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, states that it communicated to XXXX that I am a successor in interest on the account. XXXX claims to have no record of that. But more importantly, I am the administrator of the estate ( in addition to being a XXXX ) and have been for a year and a half. I have been communicating with WF as the estate - and therefore the rightful account holder - since fall XXXX. They - by their own admission- apparently did not inform XXXX of this, and therefore prevented me from being able to in any way communicate with XXXX  regarding the mortgage"

I request an immediate investigation into these entities and their practices to prevent further damages to others. 
XXXX XXXX contacted me through XXXX and email to seek US Representatives to facilitate their business services and collect outstanding debts from clients. I found them to be a legitimate company and decided to collaborate with them. Subsequently, I was assigned a client, XXXX XXXX, from XXXX XXXX XXXX, associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who had an outstanding debt of {$350000.00}. 
After extensive communication, XXXX XXXX issued a check for {$99000.00}, which I deposited at Wells Fargo. Bank confirmed the availability of funds before accepting the deposit. Following XXXX XXXX 's instructions, I also wired {$89000.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, under the name of XXXX XXXX, at XXXX XXXX ( account number : XXXX, routing number : XXXX ). However, a week later, I received a debt memo on my bank account for {$99000.00}, as the bank account from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX '' had XXXX XXXX. 
Despite my efforts to retract the wire transfer at XXXX XXXX, I have not been able to recover the funds. I have contacted XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, but have received no response. I was informed by Wells Fargo that the situation was recognized as fraud 20 months ago, and that they stated that I wouldn't "" be liable, '' and "" the fraud wouldn't harm '' me. Yet, I recently received a statement from Wells Fargo claiming I owe the amount again. When I inquired about this, they informed me that they have been trying for 20 months to retract the wire transfer, to which they have not. 
I received correspondence from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/2021 regarding the Resolution of claim for your account # XXXX from Claims Assistance. 
Upon receiving this notice, I promptly contacted Wells Fargos fraud department to inquire about the nature of this claim. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and her XXXX, XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/2021. They assured me not to worry and that the claim was under fraud review. They stated Claims Assistance was handling the matter. I then spoke with XXXX individuals from Claims Assistance who referred me to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2021, I spoke with XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX. He was unable to locate details on the claim number but stated he would research the matter further. He then transferred me back to the Fraud Unit. I ultimately spoke with XXXX XXXX, a Fraud Claims Specialist, who clearly stated, this matter was deemed as fraud. There was a credit issued to your account for {$98000.00} minus a {$240.00} fee. You no longer have a balance, it is {$0.00} and we've closed the credit balance. You don't owe anything. You are not liable. 
Given the verbal and written confirmations I received from multiple Wells Fargo representatives over a month-long period in XXXX and XX/XX/2021 regarding the resolution and closure of this fraud claim, I do not understand why I am now being contacted about this matter almost 20 months later. Wells Fargo did will not provide all internal documentation that details the steps taken by Wells Fargo, if any, to recall the wire transfer initiated by the perpetrator of this fraud, XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, on my account ending in XXXX ( routing number XXXX ). When I first reported this fraud, I urged Wells Fargo representatives to retract the wire transfer to no avail and was even told I would need to ask XXXX XXXX  to recall it instead. 
In summary, I received consistent and definitive confirmation from Wells Fargo that this fraud claim was resolved, my account balance was {$0.00}, and no further action was required on my part.

Complaint : Wells Fargo has activate some sort of AUTO BILL service for a credit card that is not even in my possession and for which has not been authorized by the business customer to be pulled from any of the multiple business checking/saving accounts associated with the business. Automatically linking a credit card account to some checking account without customer pre-authorization or knowledge, in addition to linking it to some "" default '' checking or saving account is potentially harmful to the customer, since there may not be funds available and may cause overdraft fees"
4/28/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"The Account ending in XXXX : 1 ) Froze/Closed legitimate Wells Fargo Checking Account : Freezing ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and closing ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) my Wells Fargo account without reason or notice. 

2 ) Wells Fargo Entered Three Late Payments For a Now Paid Off Car Loan : Between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo lodged three 30 days late payments on my credit reports which were not late. 

Other : 3 ) Wells Fargo Opened Two Fraud Accounts In My Name : This was discovered on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX  when a man by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) called me and demanded I pay {$860.00} for a Wells Fargo account or I was going to be served the same day. 

1 ) Wells Fargo Froze Closed My Legitimate Wells Fargo Account Ending in XXXX : XXXX XXXX of XXXX : My Wells Fargo account ending in XXXX was frozen without notice. I found out while driving on the way back from Texas when I tried to get gas at a gas station. I called Wells Fargo and I was told that my account was frozen and to unfreeze it I had to go to my branch in XXXX XXXX, AL and present ID. I was told that I could not solve the issue over the phone. I advised Wells Fargo that freezing my account left me stranded because I could not buy enough gas to get home. They did not care. 

I am a rated XXXX veteran and I was left stranded in the middle of nowhere and had to borrow money from strangers at two different gas stations because I had only {$50.00} cash on hand to get home to Alabama when Wells Fargo froze my account without reason and would not fix the issue over the phone. This left me EXTREMELY vulnerable as a XXXX female begging for cash at two gas stations along the XXXX for two days. I could not even get anyone to send me money because when they froze my account I had no banking account to send the money to. There are several people I called asking for help that day and they are witnesses. 

Once I finally made it home two days later, my friend took me down to the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, AL and brought my ID. No one at Wells Fargo could tell me why my account was frozen and it took 6 hours in person at the bank to unfreeze it. 

XXXX XXXX of XXXX : Wells Fargo closed my account without reason. I found out when I went to make a purchase but it was declined. Again, I had to have someone take me down to the Wells Fargo bank in person in XXXX XXXX, AL and fight for SEVEN HOURS to get my money out of the bank. I was never given a reason for why they shut the account down. While Wells says I shut the account down, in fact Wells Fargo refused access to the account and I spent 7 hours at the XXXX XXXX, Al office trying to get my money back. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : I called Wells Fargo at XXXX to file a claim for the CFPB settlement dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX against Wells Fargo because they froze and closed accounts with no reason given to this day. I asked for the reason my account was frozen in XXXX of XXXX and closed in XXXX of XXXX. Wells Fargo still can not tell me why, but they told me to go get a lawyer if I wanted to file a claim. 

The CFPB is clear about how to file a claim against Wells Fargo for frozen/closed accounts. I called the XXXX given by the CFPB and asked to file a claim against the CFPB settlement for Wells Fargo frozen/closed accounts. I do not need a lawyer. 

2 ) Wells Fargo Incorrectly Entered Three Late Payments On My Credit Reports. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo lodged three 30 days late payments for a car loan which were not late : 1 x 30 days late each in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

These incorrect late payment reports were disputed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX with Wells Fargo and credit agencies which negatively impacted my credit score. 

Wells Fargo deliberately applied the payments late. This is ACTUALLY why the CFPB has taken the consent decree against Wells Fargo ... for applying payments late and charging late fees. 

I have NO other late payments ever on my credit report except Wells Fargo Car Loan. It makes no sense other than Wells Fargo did exactly what the CFPB Consent Decree states : Wells Fargo deliberately applied the payments late and charges fraudulent late fees. 

Because Wells Fargo refused to respond and remove the incorrect information on my credit reports, I ended up paying 3.5 % instead of a lower 3.0 % interest rate on my home loan with XXXXXXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Over the thirty year life of the loan the difference in interest rates will needlessly cost me approximately {$12000.00} more. 

While these late payments eventually dropped off my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, I have the copies of the disputes I filed which were never addressed by Wells Fargo and resulted in a higher interest rate on my home loan. 

3 ) Wells Fargo Opened Two Fraud Accounts In My Name : This was discovered on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX when a man by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) called me and demanded I pay {$860.00} for a Wells Fargo account or I was going to be served the same day. After an entire year of providing documents to Wells Fargo, it was discovered there were in fact two fraud accounts in my name I did not know about as admitted by Wells Fargo. These have been settled with Wells Fargo. SO YES WELLS FARGO HAD TWO FRAUD ACCOUNTS IN MY NAME. 

Enclosed you will find the cashier check stub from Wells Fargo that was FINALLY settled on XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, 15 months after the call came from Wells Fargo threatening to sue me if I did not pay {$860.00} for the fraud account Wells Fargo opened in my name. 

You can refer to Wells Fargo Mediation Tracking Number XXXX, Case Number XXXX. 

How is it that you have no idea this happened and claimed you could not find any unauthorized open account when Wells already admitted it and paid them out? 

What is going on there? 


CONCLUSION : Wells Fargo continues to violate laws and CFPB court decree settlement dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that has severely negatively impacted customers through no fault of their own. Wells Fargo has no idea what is going on at Wells Fargo. 

I am asking that : 1 ) Wells Fargo stop trying to stop legitimate CFPB claims from being filed and incorrectly telling customers to get a lawyer. 

2 ) Wells Fargo addresses and compensates for my Frozen/Closed checking account ending in XXXX I am asking for {$2000.00} given the fact Wells Fargo put me in such a dangerous situation and stranded on the road when they froze my account and then closed my account without warning or reason and made it extremely difficult to access my money. 

4 ) I am compensated for the difference I now pay on my home loan because Wells Fargo would not remove the incorrect late payment information about my car loan which is {$12000.00}. 

I have all the phone numbers, dates, times and people who I have spoken with at Wells Fargo to date about these issues. If you would like these details, please contact me as I have documents and call logs to support this letter if needed. 

I have witnesses to all of the activities and events if you need sworn statements. I have many documents as well."

This put my credit card utilization at 98 % usage and caused my credit score to drop 40 points. I was told by Wells Fargo that a letter was sent out, yet I did not receive a letter notifying me of this. I have had this particular credit card with Wells Fargo for 10 years with no late payments. I have my checking and savings accounts with Wells Fargo as well as a persona loan. My complaint is that no one took into account the banking relationship that I have had with Wells Fargo and arbitrarily decreased my limit without notification. I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has severely effected my credit score and no one at Wells Fargo can give me a satisfactory explanation as to why this was done. It questions the integrity of who is making these banking decisions and why a long time customer could be considered a risk at a bank that handles the majority of my banking needs. I question continuing the banking relationship if this is not resolved satisfactorily."

I also received numerous of emails on that day saying that more money was trying to be taken out but It declined. I also told them I believed that my account has been entered by someone without my permission because there were changes to my account that I did not make. They told me to change my password and I did but yet nothing had changed.

4/28/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"My credit card information was stolen and used to make a series of fraudulent charges from XXXX XXXX XXXX. This was a card I hardly used and I had the card on autopay so this went unnoticed until XX/XX/XXXX. The charges started off small ( which is how I didn't notice it among my other payments ), but then became much larger starting in XXXX. This change prompted me to see what had been occurring for months, so I reached out to Wells Fargo for assistance in resolving this issue and reimbursing me for fraudulent charges. 

I called Wells Fargo to report fraud. I went through each charge from XXXX XXXX XXXX and documented the fraudulent charges. There were 57 charges which totaled {$1500.00}. After this call, I was supposed to receive a letter confirming the case was opened and notice of a resolution within 15-20 business days. Neither of these things happened. The only follow up that was executed was that they closed that card number and sent me a new credit card to use which I received in the specified 7 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the fraud department again to check on my case. I had received a few hundred dollars in reimbursements, but the rest was not reimbursed and I had not received any correspondence that the case existed. When calling the second time, I learned that my claim had been mostly denied because by continuing to pay my credit card on autopay, I had "" accepted responsibility '' for the charges- according to Wells Fargo. I had them re-open the claim, went through each of the charges with them again, and was told I would receive a letter confirming that the case was opened and a notice of the outcome within 15-20 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the fraud department for two reasons. First because I received a notification that my card was attempted to be used for a charge that I recognized as fraudulent. Since the card was turned off, the charge was denied, but I was confused how this card could have already been stolen again when I had not attempted to use it. Second, I wanted to check the status of my fraud claim since I I had not received any further reimbursements. 

The fraud department once again closed my card and is sending me a new card. The fraud department told me that my claims had been denied again because I "" accepted responsibility by paying my credit card. '' I once again re-opened a claim and was told that I will receive confirmation that the claim exists. Based off the previous responses, I am doubtful that I will receive resolution and therefore am escalating this issue. I am becoming skeptical my fraud claims are being opened and investigated. According to federal law, I should not be financially responsible for fraudulent claims made within 60 days of reporting them, and many of the fraudulent charges that were within 60 days of XX/XX/XXXX were not reimbursed by Wells Fargo. 

I am hoping by escalating this issue I can receive reimbursement for the fraudulent charges made on my Wells Fargo credit card."

Again, they are not accepting any responsibility to allow this to happen. NOT ONE ( 1 ) time did Wells Fargo call or notify us to any of these charges finding it suspicious.

When I found out all of those little charges totaled over XXXX dollars, Wells Fargo submitted a claim. 

6 business days later, I found more fraudulent charges by another gambling company ( XX/XX/XXXX ). At this time, Wells Fargo did not stop the charges or think to contact us when over 78 charges were made to a betting site over the course of 5 days. Again, I was not checking my bank account, as there was a claim already open and I didnt even have access to a debit card. 

When I called to file yet another claim, the employee stated that the other claim was closed and denied and that the reason it was denied was because I didnt report it sooner. Is that legal? To say, too late, you didnt notice fast enough, now its gone? It is XXXX dollars. XXXX dollars is not able to be returned to us. None of those charges were made by myself or my husband. 

There is currently another claim open for another XXXX dollars that was taken while the XXXX dollar claim was in the process of being denied. 

I spoke with a Wells Fargo manager. The manager was kind enough to file a complaint against the claim result but with no guarantee. In what world is this fair? 

I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and my husband is in XXXX XXXX. We are hardworking citizens. XXXX dollars of fraudulent charges in 4 months and not one alert, not one cause for concern? Now, when we are uncovering how long this has been going on for, they just say no? This is not acceptable. It is our money that we work really hard for.

So as I arrived at the Wells Fargo office in XXXX Florida, I told the young lady that I was there to fill out this paperwork for refinance for a lower mortgage rate.

The problem is the date was six months earlier than the date that I was sitting in their office as I pointed that out to the representative she again went to the back spoke to someone came back and said thats because the paperwork was processed when it was sent out which didnt make a lot of sense to me but she said go ahead and sign everything we sent it in. We have a team of lawyers that will correct it. They will send you out a new payment book. The reason I went to the Wells Fargo office was because it was their loan and I wanted to make sure there were no issues so I assumed that since they are telling me this was a standard practice I went ahead and signed everything sent it in and it was months before I heard anything back. I had tried calling several times and I actually told them I would make a double payment just to avoid any issues but they said there was no payment to be made. They were still working on the modification. 

After several calls and three months later, I got a letter that stated when my next payment date would be which was again XX/XX/XXXX one week later I received another letter that said my modification was XXXX void due to nonpayment and that I owe them nearly {$10000.00}. I thought for months to try to speak to representative. I got the runaround for several months with many threats to take my home so I hired an attorney, which in the end Wells Fargo foreclosed on my home. I had lived in this home for 20 years with no issues until Wells Fargo contacted me to get a lower interest rate and in the end I feel there was much deception that led to me losing my home when I called to tell them that I wanted them to pull the recordings of me calling and talking to representatives at the beginning of every call, it would say this call is being recorded for quality that supervisor called me back and said unfortunately, none of those recordings exist again feeling nothing but deception."

Although my credit was and is excellent I was given a no-doc 80/20 loan to finance the home. During that timeframe, I applied for a loan modification and was twice denied both times. I subsequently sold my home in XXXX to avoid losing it. Based a number of CFPB enforcement actions and class-actions I believe I am entitled to a settlement. I opened a complaint ( XXXX ) with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and was denied. However, the investigation failed to address the loan modification issue and incorrectly treated the 80/20 loans as a mortgage that was later used to get a home equity loan ( XXXX ). I subsequently opened a second complaint ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX, a supervisor that recommended a new claim to address the two distinct original concerns : discriminatory/predatory lending ( no-doc 80/20 loan ) and the denial of a loan modification. At one point he said, 'why didn't you file this complaint sooner? ' The second complaint was denied via a phone call from the case owner, XXXX XXXX. He said, 'the 80/20 loan I received was typical of that time ' so the claim was denied. He did not address the loan modification issue, when asked he said, 'I do not have an answer for why that might have happened '. He told me I would receive a letter recapping what he covered in the discussion and if I was not satisfied I could file another complaint. To date I have not received any such letter. It feels as though they are just kicking the can down the road to run out a clock.

I attach this letter below only because it is the same letter the other eleven families used and I feel that it likely describes the situation better than I can.

After the end of the letter, I will also provide a summary of relevant dates. I attach to this request eleven examples of the fraud that was perpetrated.

Exhibit 1 : LETTER EXPLAINING THE SITUATION ( as sent to Wells ) To whom it may concern, The below letter and attachments reference Case # : XXXX. I attach this information in hopes you can help me resolve a fraud situation. Your help would be greatly appreciated. 

Specifically, we incurred a ( initial ) loss of {$10000.00} in XXXX, due to fraud that was committed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' ) and its head XXXX XXXX. About a dozen other parents in the same situation as us were reimbursed by their banking institution, so I am hoping that Wells Fargo will be able to do the same.. 

Some background information : My wife and I were intending to send our daughter, XXXX, to a school in XXXX named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' ) for their 3-year-old program beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. We sent deposits totalling {$10000.00} from our Wells Fargo checking account via ACH. ( {$6700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$3300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ). 

In XXXX of XXXX, an online article reported that The School was behind on its rent. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX - XXXX ) The School repeatedly communicated to the parents ( via XXXX meetings, emails, etc ) that while there was a dispute between itself and its landlord, it was confident the issue would eventually be resolved and that the XXXX school year would not be affected. In doing so, The School fraudulently conveyed itself as solvent and capable of operating, when in reality it was already facing eviction and default. Our payment in XX/XX/XXXX was sent based on these fraudlent assurances On XX/XX/XXXX, The School board informed parents via email that the school was not able to resolve issues with its landlord and as such, the XXXX school year would be canceled. The same communication offered up the possibility of recouping some of our deposits, but no such reimbursements have been made. 

My wife and I sent over tuition deposit payments believing that the school had every intention of opening in XX/XX/XXXX. Had the school properly disclosed and informed us of its true state of its finances, we would not have proceeded with making deposit payments. The school made false and misleading statements to us and to other parents in order to fraudulently solicit tuition payments from us. At the time of these statements, administrators already knew that there was a high likelihood that the school would not be able to open for the XXXX academic year. The school 's XXXX page was actively recruiting students as late as XX/XX/XXXX. 

I've attached supporting correspondence from The School. I would welcome the chance to speak live via telephone to discuss further. Thank you in advance for your assistance. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX Exhibit 2 : RELEVANT DATES Pre XX/XX/XXXX, all relevant dates are summarized in the email above XX/XX/XXXX. My wife calls Wells and opens a XXXX # : XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX. My wife calls Wells help line approximately twenty five times. They are unable to provide updates of any sort. 

XX/XX/XXXX. My wife finally is able to connect with a claims representative, who explains that because this was an ACH transaction, Wells Fargo does not reimburse for fraud ( this turned out to be a lie, as every other financial institution faced with the same fact pattern has paid in full ). At this point, we simply gave up. 

XXXX of XXXX. I am having lunch with another father that was affected by this situation. He tells me that every single other family has already received payment from their financial services institution. I begin trying to contact Wells again, thinking that if I simply use the same materials that the other eleven families have used with their financial institutions, that we can arrive at a reasonable outcome. 

XX/XX/XXXX. I call Wells Fargo help line ten separate times. I am told first that too much time has passed since the original claim ( this was false ), second that Wells is unable to receive supporting information in electronic form ( this was false ), third that I would receive a call back from a case worker by XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( this was false ), and fourth that I could call a help line any time and receive an update on my file ( this was false, every time I have called the help line I have been transferred several times only to be told there is no open case, at which point, if I persist, I can generally get to a department that at least acknowledges this case exists ). 


My wife spent probably fifty hours trying to get Wells to review this case. I have now spent around thirty. They are impossible to reach by ordinary means and I believe have set up their help system in a manner that is difficult to use to demoralize potential claimants."

I nor anyone known to me or my husband made these charges. The fraudulents charges were made at XXXX XXXX in the amount of XXXX and some store called XXXX for XXXX. 

In essence, Wells Fargo is accusing me of 1 ) filing a false fraud claim and 2 ) filing a false police report for the fraudulent charges. When I first reported the fraud, Wells Fargo said nothing about filing a poliice report then said I had to, so I did, They still insist the fraudulent charges are valid which is against the law.

Wells Fargo continues to avoid responding to this serious matter. 

Wells Fargo denied that it is the appropriate company to this complaint on XX/XX/XXXX and yet again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In its most recent response on XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo again avoids responding to this complaint stating that it has received correspondence through the CFPB pertaining to the servicing of a mortgage. 

This complaint is pertaining to WELLS FARGO. 

WELLS FARGO initiated foreclosure proceedings against me back on XX/XX/XXXX claiming to be Holder in Due Course and Owner of the Note and Mortgage at issue. 

As evidenced in the attached, The XXXX XXXX found that Wells Fargo failed to prove ownership of the Note and Mortgage at issue. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  have both collaborated in this Wrongful Foreclosure action against me as mentioned in my previous complaints by submitting False, Forged, Fraudulent and Fabricated Affidavits of Amounts Owed and a Corrective Assignment of Mortgage. As evidenced in the XXXX XXXX XXXX, the affidavits are invalid. 

I am attaching the Pooling and Servicing Agreement which makes it abundantly clear on page 33 of the Prospectus that the Trustee "" MAY NOT '' be able to Enforce the Mortgage Note. 

This is corroboration documentation substantiating the fact that WELLS FARGO has Wrongfully pursued Foreclose against my property. 

I have requested that Wells Fargo include me in the XX/XX/XXXX consent judgement and I am asking the CFPB order WELLS FARGO to comply. 

I have also requested Wells Fargo to Rescind the Instrument and execute a Quiet Title. 

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

The caller stated that there was a pending XXXX fraudulent transaction of {$950.00} and asked me to verify my last few transactions with them. I did so and stated that I did not authorize a transaction of {$950.00}. The caller said they would need to push a XXXX retrieval transaction to reverse the fraudulent charge, as Wells Fargo needs something to cancel on their end in order to get the {$950.00} back. The caller stated that the account flagged for fraudulent activity was under the name of XXXX XXXX. I was skeptical at this point, but they reassured me they were a Wells Fargo employee and the caller gave me their name, and employee information, and told me that I could verify the phone number they were calling from as the Wells Fargo department. I did google the phone number, and it came up as Wells Fargo Customer Service. In addition, they said they could verify that they were from Wells Fargo by sending a push notification to my phone ( I attached the files below ). Once they sent the push notification, it was from the same number that I get my other Wells Fargo push notifications from so this convinced me that it was actually Wells Fargo. They stated I would need to send a XXXX under the name of XXXX XXXX 's so they could start a fraud investigation. Once I sent the XXXX, the caller gave me a case ID number and stated to call back Wells Fargo in a few days for more information on the fraud case. 
When I called back the next day, the customer service rep informed me that I had been a victim of fraud and this was a very popular scam that Wells Fargo has been having increased issues with. The rep assured me that they would be there to help every step of the way. They immediately froze my accounts, shut off my Wells Fargo account access, and stated they would keep me updated on the claim. 
Unfortunately, I never heard back from them besides a few letters in the mail updating me that they were continuing to assist me in my claim. I had to call them over the span of many weeks repeatedly. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I had no new information. Each time I called, I was put on hold for hours and transferred repeatedly in circles. I was still locked out of my account and unable to access any of my account information for many weeks. I could not check my account balance, monitor my transactions, or make any payments to my credit card. 
When I called today XX/XX/XXXX, I finally got through to a customer service rep after many transfers and was told that the claim was denied and the transaction was not fraudulent. This was the first time I had heard of this, and I got no notification in the mail or through the email that my claim was denied. In addition, the fraud representative was highly insensitive and blamed me stating "" well, you sent the money ''. I asked to speak to someone else and she refused and transferred back to the main menu as opposed to escalating me to the right department. I called back and then was transferred again numerous times with customer service reps unwilling to open a new claim. They stated that they can not and will not help me. I don't feel safe and secure with Wells Fargo and feel extremely disheartened about this situation and the lack of accountability by Wells Fargo.

Wells Fargo did not acknowledge nor address their "" robo signing illegalities, '' with regards to the foreclosure documents that I received that were not signed nor notarized.

Their was a national settlement foreclosure agreement that includes wells Fargo. That agreement specifically states '' settlement does not release private claims by individual."

Loan payments and renovations made to the property was not reimbursed. Seeking to payment and information on how the loan payments were applied by Wells Fargo. 

There was an agreement between the owner/seller and the buyer/renovator. A Quit Claim Deed discrepancy was challenged by the seller who requested the property be returned to him. {$850.00} was paid on the WELLS FARGO loan for 3 years by the buyer/renovator.

At some point it was shared that the first owner had missed payments that he did not disclose to the buyer. 

Ultimately, the house was foreclosed. No money was returned to the buyer. The buyer has paperwork indicating payments made to WELLS FARGO and the Quit Claim deed. 

There is no proof that the loan payments made by the buyer/renovator to WELLS FARGO were applied to the loan.

However, on Monday, XX/XX/2023, I received an email from Wells Fargo indicating that the account in which the above mentioned check was deposited has gone into overdraft. 

Wells Fargo never informed me of the deposit being withheld until I called to find out why my account went into overdraft. 

I called Wells Fargo and was told that the deposit is on hold until XX/XX/2023. The reason I was given is that the payee 's bank is withholding payment due to suspicious activity on the payee 's account. 

I contacted the payee ( my customer ) to let her know of what Wells Fargo said and that she should contact her bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to check on the supposed "" suspicious activity ''. The payee ; my customer, did call her bank and was informed that no such suspicious activities was detected and furthermore informed her that the check in question has been paid and cleared their system. 

I must point out that I've been doing business with the payee for over 10 years and the checks have always been from the same XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account. Furthermore, I deposit XXXX to XXXX checks per year from the same payee and from the same XXXX XXXX  XXXX account. 

Wells Fargo has been given the funds by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX but chooses to withhold it for no good reason. 

The suspicious activities are those of Wells Fargo and not the payee 's account or bank. 

I'd appreciate your serious attention to this matter as I'm certain I'm not the only Wells Fargo customer who has been subjected to this kind of Suspicious Activities by a financial institution known for its unethical behavior.

I asked if the transactions can be canceled I was told multiple times that even if they are reflecting pending that there was nothing they can do to stop them from processing. There were more transactions that already went through of the amount of {$40000.00} and they said that they will investigate and let me know if they are able to give me the money back.

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX saying that someone was cashing this check. I told them not to cash it under any circumstances. Somehow the check was cashed anyway. I then contacted Wells Fargo and reported the fraud. They said I would have to file a fraud claim and they will send me the Affidavit of check fraud. After a month, the form never arrived even after 2 more requests. On XX/XX/XXXX I when into my local branch and completed the form. I was told that the matter would be resolved within 10 days. After 10 days I called to inquire about the claim. Over the next 2 weeks, I spoke to 4 different people each one with higher authority than the other, and received no update or help on resolving this matter. Each person I was referred to knew another about my claim or had anything in their system about my claim. Also, the said is that we are doing the best we can do, we have turned this matter over to XXXX and declined any provisional credit.

A few days later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message that they need 10 days for a response t my complaint.

He research the matter and spoke with management in the Executive office and promised me that they would escalate my complaint and contact me by phone. I have yet to receive a phone call.

To prevent fines and late fees I had to take out a loan to pay the property taxes. My concern is that WF is not engaged in resolving this matter.

I am writing to you regarding my business checking account with Wells Fargo. Recently, I discovered a repeating transaction of {$850.00} every month, originating from the same check that was issued in XX/XX/2022. 

I immediately contacted Wells Fargo to investigate the matter and was shocked to learn that the same check had been cashed by the person for 11 times. Wells Fargo Banker also confirmed that the person was able to cash the check using the same instrument. 

Despite this clear case of fraudulent activity, Wells Fargo informed me that they were unable to stop the payment and issued a claim letter stating that they would not reimburse me for the almost {$9000.00} that was fraudulently withdrawn from my account. 

As you are aware, banks have a duty to exercise reasonable care in processing checks and transactions and to prevent fraudulent activity. However, it appears that Wells Fargo failed in their duty to detect and prevent this fraudulent activity, which resulted in a significant loss to my business. 

I would appreciate your urgent assistance in this matter, and I am seeking your guidance on how to proceed further. Thank you for your attention to this matter."
5/2/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"On or about XX/XX/2010, we applied for a conventional refinance of an existing loan with Wells Fargo and received a loan disclosure statement which contained the terms and conditions of the refinance loan. 
Within the required three-day rescission period, we sent a written notice of rescission to Wells Fargo by overnight mail, requesting to cancel the refinance loan. This notice of rescission was delivered to Wells Fargo as confirmed by the United States Postal Service and the postmaster. 
Wells Fargo failed to honor our rescission request within the required twenty-day period. 
Instead, Wells Fargo instructed us to continue making payments on what we believed was the original loan, pending Wells Fargos response to the rescission request. 
We complied with these instructions and made payments on the what we believed was the original loan for approximately two years.

During this time, we repeatedly contacted us Wells Fargo by phone and by mail, demanding a reply to the rescission request and an explanation of the status of the loan. We never received a response.

Upon advice of one of Wells Fargos mortgage specialists, we stopped making payments on the original loan, as a prerequisite for applying for a loan modification. 
Unbeknownst to us, the original loan had been extinguished by the new unapproved loan. This was not a conventional loan it was a modified loan. 
We agreed to a loan modification document with a trial payment plan, which required three monthly payments, but unbeknownst to us this process was not even possible because a modified loan could not be modified again so these trial payments were merely illegal debt collection tactics.

We made two payments under the trial plan but stopped making payments when Wells Fargo refused to provide any details of the new loan or confirm that Plaintiff qualified for a permanent modification.

In at least three instances Wells Fargo informed us through the XXXX Mail that we were never qualified for a loan modification because the conventional loan we thought we were getting was actually a XXXX  loan, ( therefore non convention and already considered a modified loan ). This was NEVER disclosed. 
Wells Fargo never recognized or acknowledged the rescission request or refunded any of the payments that we made on the new loan.

As a result of Wells Fargos actions and omissions, we have suffered actual damages, including but not limited to : negative impact on credit score ; physical health, emotional distress ; and attorney 's fees and costs."
5/2/23,Mortgage,Other type of mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"I was one of the customers of Wells Fargo who was denied a XXXX modification. I have not received anything from Wells Fargo. Because I lost my home it would probably be hard for anyone to reach me. Actually, I should have been one of the first people WF reached out to because I fought hard and long to get them to correct my account with excessive fees, etc.

Immediately after my husband died, I found out that Wells Fargo messed up my loan by creating an escrow account claiming I owed money for my taxes which had been paid. Also, when I carefully audited my account I found they had added a bunch of unnecessary fees. Wells Fargo double paid the taxes on my home. I contacted each taxing authority to sort things out and get proof, which I sent to Wells Fargo. Even after Wells Fargo received the proof and each taxing authority REIMBURSED them, WF still did not remove or correct the error on my account.

Later I applied for a HAMP modification which I was MORE than qualified/eligible to receive and was turned down more than nine ( 9 ) times. I worked with the people that were setup to help with modifications, I even paid people to modify my loan and each time I was denied. No one could understand why I wasn't getting approved. My attorney spoke with WF attorneys and WF 's attorney 's didn't understand why I wasn't being approved. Due to my persistence, at one point my account was handled by executive offices and even WF 's employees could not understand why I wasn't being approved. My home ended up in foreclosure several times and I even filed a lawsuit against Well Fargo and all their servicing companies. I wrote to Washington begging for help! After fighting to keep my home for years, I lost it in XXXX  and became XXXX. I was separated from my XXXX  and basically lived on the streets with my XXXX little dogs. By the grace of XXXX my XXXX  was able to stay with some friends of his until he graduated high school and went to college in XXXX XXXX 

I still have all of my documentation where I filed lawsuits against Wells Fargo and if you google me on line, you can find copies of it. I eventually had to give up the fight because I couldn't afford counsel, didn't have the knowledge or expertise to fight against WF 's team of lawyers and lost my home where I didn't have access to computers, printers or anything else needed to fight. The shocking and amazing part of my story is that I was able to help XXXX people to modify their loans and get approved for a XXXX modification... ..but couldn't get mine approved. The people I helped were in a worse situation than I was ... .but, they still got approved."

I wired funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX 's account with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX in XXXX, for the purchase of an apartment in XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, to this day ( XX/XX/2023 ), the money has not been received by XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX  has confirmed they have not received the funds. 

Despite my efforts to resolve the issue, including requesting the money to be recalled and returned to me, Wells Fargo informed me that XXXX in XXXX XXXX, the intermediary bank, was holding the money and conducting an investigation. However, the nature of that investigation remains unknown to me. I filed a formal complaint through your office ( Complaint ID XXXX ) against Wells Fargo XXXX XX/XX/2023. Wells Fargo responded to my concerns on XX/XX/2023, stating they had reached out to XXXX four times with no response, the case remains open. On XX/XX/2023, Wells Fargo informed me they had made three attempts to confirm credit, but there was no response from the beneficiary bank, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX As a result, the letter stated that Wells Fargo would close the file, and no further action would be taken, which is unacceptable. 

I called the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2023, and requested them to reopen the case. However, they advised me to contact XXXX directly since XXXX was ignoring the interbank Swift messages sent by Wells Fargo. I am not a XXXX client, and I believe it is not my responsibility to resolve this issue. This is a matter that should be resolved by the two banks, XXXX and Wells Fargo and not left to an individual to directly resolve by following up with a bank of which they are not a client. 

Due to this long delay, I am unsure if I will be able to purchase my apartment as agreed upon with the seller. This has caused me considerable emotional distress. Wells Fargo and XXXX have yet to provide a clear explanation as to why my hard-earned money is still being held and not returned to me. I suspect that the banks are ignoring me and not taking my complaints seriously, possibly because I am a minority. 

The mismanagement of this wire transaction demonstrates a profound sense of arrogance and disregard for professional courteousness. Therefore, I am seeking a full refund of the wired amount ( {$33000.00} ), as well as compensation for any additional expenses incurred as a result of Wells Fargo and XXXX 's negligence. 
I hope that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can assist me in resolving this matter in a timely and satisfactory manner. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I had contacted them multiple times regarding overdraft fees and received many excuses. Can someone please help me in figuring out why I was excluded from any compensation for there one of many wrongdoings.. 

Also, I had to let my credit card with Wells Fargo close and go to collections over an unfair reversal that was hit on my account after being told my dispute after being ripped off by was settled and closed only to be recharged for this amount many months later was just unbelievable. I was told it was closed and this showed as closed on the website/app I don't understand how you can just come back many months later and charge me again after you "" closed '' this case.

None of these actions were performed or approved by myself. Wells Fargo called, and I did not answer. I called Wells Fargo myself to ensure safety. The person I reached was informative enough, they actually informed me that somebody accessed my online account, and that the person who accessed my account was able to disable my text notifications that would normally notify me of account changes and transactions ; this action allowed the unauthorized user to add themselves as a recipient of wire transactions. From there, they were able to transfer money electronically to their XXXX account without my knowledge. I only found out about the balance change in my account after this informative conversation with Wells Fargo. The only immediate action that was taken by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX was the change to my username, password, and they also closed my compromised accounts and reversed the {$400.00} transfer. The {$400.00} reversal did not help my situation but at least this did show that Wells Fargo agreed with me that the action was fraudulent.

Instead I was told that I was they called XXXX and XXXX said the money is gone so there is nothing Wells Fargo could or would do. To sum things up, Wells Fargo said 3 things : 1 ) That the XXXX account the funds were transferred to was empty so they couldnt return me my money ( it took them a couple of days to even try to get the money back ). 2 ) that it was my fault and that I must have authorized the transaction even though I never approved any transaction 3 ) that they were closing the case without a refund and there is nothing more they could do."

I sent Wells Fargo information proving my ex-husband and I lived at separate addresses at the time he did this and a cash out mortgage 2 years later showing it wasnt on my credit report to pay off at the closing. they are still saying it isnt fraud bc he used our joint checking account to pay the payment like he did for all his debt and bc I own the property where the merchandise was installed. I didnt even live at the property at the time of installation which I also proved. Plus, This is not a secured debt. I proved to Wells Fargo that I didnt know about the debt until after my exhusbands death. I due diligently sent them solid proof of the two different residences and even my digital signature which was not used to sign the contract for the card. My partial name typed out was used to sign the document. They are not using the definition of fraud to determine my case. They are just going by the fact that the merchandise increases the value of my property. Which it does not bc my property is only valued for the land not the building per the tax records. I actually have a negative against the house on my taxes records bc the building is devalued by the tax dept. I can provide proof if they would like the tax statement on my home. I have been contacting Wells Fargo since last year of this issue. It has effected my credit score and cost me thousands of dollars for my husband to have used my information to gain this card. Ive also offered to provide proof that we had no debt in 2019 together not even my mortgage or any debt there after. And Wells Fargo doesnt care about the facts. Ive done everything theyve asked of me only to be denied my fraud claim for the same unproven reasons even after supervisor told me to provide proof I lived at a separate address. No check is signed by me and the first correspondence they had with me about this debt was a month after my husbands death when I was contacting all his creditors about his death and making payments until his estate was set up. They didnt even have my telephone number or email Or employment information until I started fighting with them. They only had my social security number and a value of my income. I even proved my husband lied on the application about his income. He has no income at the time and it states he has XXXX XXXX month. And they only have his email address that I didnt even know he had until they sent me a copy of the digitally signed contract he signed through his email. I was forced to settle this debt to keep it from further ruining my debt bc unlike what I was told by the people at Wells Fargo- they were reporting late payments against me.

Moreover, WELLS FARGO AUTO has not responded to my affidavit, with a affidavit sign under the penalty of perjury, which is a violation of the Graham Leach Bailey act. 
I am deeply concerned about the impact this is having on my life. The harassment has caused significant hardship for me, including damaging my credit, reputation, and overall financial well-being. I would like to be compensated for the difficulties and suffering that I have endured. IM SO TIRED OF HARASSMENT & VIOLATIONS!!! 
Therefore, I urge the CFPB to conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and take appropriate action against WELLS FARGO AUTO. I demand that the company adhere to all laws and regulations and respect my rights and privacy."

5/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"Wells Fargo, my personal bank in XXXX, where I had opened an account in XXXX, NV as my home branch during the XXXX Mortgage downturn, deceptively opened a Business Checking account in my name, without my explicit permission, at a Northern California XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I had been accepted into graduate studies at the time, and the student loan provider made a personal call to my private number to inquire about the location of my graduate program, in the XXXX California area. The account was opened at a branch less than XXXX miles away from the location of the new program. 

The following two months I never received the loan which was disbursed from the lender, according to the school. So while the tuition was covered for me that term the additional charges for the term were not, and I endured 10 weeks of homelessness while attending the program Fast forward 2 years to XX/XX/XXXX, and the same process detailed above repeated again, where funds from the lender were not received til after the term. The XXXX XXXX XXXX campus canceled my enrollment, until I eventually discovered a large chuck of funds in a secondary account under my name at Wells Fargo. At that point the remaining funds from that account were transferred to my private personal checking account, and I repeatedly incurred low balance charges ( again, without my knowledge, as I was unaware that to close the account an entire process and processing fee was required, not just a XXXX balance ) I lost up to XXXX in low balance charges over the course of the four years ( XXXX ) the account was open without my permission or knowledge. I also lost up to XXXX in timely loan disbursements that were sent back to the federal education lender, who believed to loans were going to the wrong account in XXXX, since it did not have any of the matching information of the personal checking account that was given the school 's financial billing office"
5/3/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Overcharged for something you did purchase with the card,"I called Wells Fargo, of which I have been a customer for 17 years, to ask about two charges. Not "" dispute '' but ask for any pertinent info I could use to either call the originator of the charge or, lacking a contact phone number -- which, by the way, all retail/commercial outlets should provide regarding the routing charges on the c.c.billing statement, i.m.o. -- would file a dispute. The C.S. rep cleared up the first charge 's origination but not the second one ; she suggested that I XXXX the dubious name of place that issued a charge on my card... to try to get a number to call myself. 

W. F., apparently, has no gray areas but prefers to process these types of inquiries as all "" fraud ''. Last time this happened, after I gave permission for them to do an inquiry -- although I objected about categorizing it as "" Fraud Detection '' -- about a charge on my account. I received, two letters, mailed five days apart, however not in a timely manner, to let me know that they were closing my account and issuing a new credit card, ( if my memory serves. ) I don't even remember if I was issued a refund for the dispute ; I should go retrieve my records but I have a desk full of other pressing and worthy paperwork, at the moment. My apology! 

Today, the customer service person automatically cancelled my card without my permission, while I was on the line. When she announced this and I objected, she said she couldn't reverse her actions but put me on hold for her ~superior, of which I never got connected. ( A subsequent call resulted in the new credit card ordered by the first C.S. person, ( with seven-day delivery, by the XXXX, ) being cancelled... in order for ANOTHER new card to be issued and delivered, XXXX  XXXX! 

I pointed out the disparities and waste in this process, particularly with the lack of nuances, in that not every C.S. inquiry should be interacted and processed, only, for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXnnel up for a new type of quota system.

However Wells Fargo opened an account ending in XXXX that they have refused to send me any statements or any information concerning this account I recently spoke to a Wells Fargo representative who was answering to the fraud that took place on the other account at that time. The representative informed me that the account ended in XXXX was a legitimate account I said to the agent send me the statements from XXXX because that account was not legitimate The agent told me that she could not send me information concerning XXXX until there had been an investigation. However, according to her conversation she had informed consumer protection bureau that they were answering to my complaints concerning the other accounts today an email from Wells Fargo answering to every other account except the one ended in XXXX. Consequently, the email made reference to the account that I said was fraudulent that we had spoke about on yesterday. That was not the account that we spoke about. We spoke about the account ending in XXXX and account in which Wells Fargo refused to send any statements or acknowledge that that account was in my name only on the phone did the representative say we didn't send information about XXXX because the consumer only reported the account ended in XXXX to CFPB. I wanr to inform you that I need Wells Fargo to reply to my request to receive statements from account in it in XXXX This is the account that someone had opened and was sending monies to someone at XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX  XXXX and other utilities in the city of XXXX AL.

A couple of hours later, the same person tried to do two other illegal wire transfers and Wells Fargo allowed them to go through. I called multiple Wells Fargo numbers and talked to at least eight different people. I received a letter from their fraud department that they determined I initiated these illegal wire transfers and that is not the case. The illegal wire transfers began around XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/2023. The illegal wire transfer that were allowed to go through happened around XXXX XXXX  on the same date.

Wells Fargo Bank has incorrectly denied my mortgage loan modification applications and miscalculated fees and other charges notwithstanding that I am a qualified borrower. 
Wells Fargo 's process for evaluating my loan modification applications was also affected by errors in the relevant calculation formulas. These errors resulted in an overstatement of the attorneys fees included in the calculation, which sometimes caused me as a qualified borrower not to be offered a loan modification. To date Wells Fargo has not addressed the error nor provide remediation to my mortgage account that experienced incorrect loss- mitigation outcomes, including wrongful foreclosure. 
Wells Fargo 's mortgage servicing operations experienced other errors that resulted in Wells Fargo assessing my mortgage unwarranted charges and fees, which include, failing to timely pay the appropriate amount of my property taxes; miscalculated the interest rate on my adjustable-rate mortgages and did not give me information about my ability to stop paying for expensive private mortgage insurance. Wells Fargo acts and practices has caused substantial injury to me."

5/3/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I was the president of my local chapter of an XXXX fraternity at the XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX for the calendar year of XXXX. I was XXXX of XXXX key executives along with the treasurer of the fraternity of a small business checking account with Wells Fargo from which the fraternal organization held funds and transacted payments. 

This complaint has to do with check fraud that occurred to the small business checking account, and the lack of timely action from the bank after we completed the bank 's fraud claims process. At the current moment, the bank, Wells Fargo, has received and processed our fraud claims affidavit ; however, they state they are unable to refund the fraudulent check and are awaiting the fraudster 's bank to act. Our organization is at risk of financial issues as the fraudulently cashed check was a significant rent payment in the order of {$17000.00}. Having been unable to pay that rent the organization has had to defer rent to its landlord and its operations are significantly hindered. We are asking CFPB to escalate the issue with Wells Fargo and seek a refund of the check fraud immediately ; we have completed all steps on our side and can not wait much longer. 

The details of the check fraud and subsequent actions by me follow. The details are repeated in the affidavit of check fraud sent to Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX, a senior fraud analyst at XXXX  XXXX XXXX. She requested I verify the check 's validity. The check 's recipient had been fraudulently altered to a new name, from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I then contacted the other account key XXXX, and proceeded to review recently cashed checks. They confirmed the check was altered to a new payee by an unauthorized third party fraudulently. 

The fraud was reported later that day to the Wells Fargo small business phone line for checking account fraud. The fraud was also reported to the USPS postal inspection service ; the case number is XXXX. The claim number with Wells Fargo is XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed the completed affidavit of check fraud I received from the Claims Assistance Center of Wells Fargo to the center. In the interim between reporting the fraud and this date, the checking account was rolled over to a new one due to the fraud, and a routine change in leadership happened in the fraternal organization. This contributed to the delay, along with XXXX previous attempts to complete the affidavit being lost in the mail or being filled out incorrectly. On XX/XX/XXXX I called the Wells Fargo small business fraud claims phone line. The agent confirmed receipt of the affidavit. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the issue remains unresolved. On my most recent call with Well Fargo to obtain an update, they stated they are unable to do anything further, and are waiting on XXXX  XXXX XXXX, the fraudster 's bank, to continue. 

The current wait to be reimbursed funds is unbearable for the organization. We have missed rent and had to divert funds to cover this essentially lost money. It is also evident that the check has been fraudulently cashed and there is no reason to have to had waited for so long. We appreciate any help."
5/3/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Traveler's check or cashier's check,Fraud or scam,None,"This was sent to the Wells Fargo ( WF ) Board XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The fact that this check fraud was committed with a Government check, intended for the Federal Reserve, but endorsed, processed and deposited into a clients account the the ease that it was, tells me that it is not a isolated incident. I would be concerned how many funds, intended for the Federal Reserve, are being held illegally by WF. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern, et al ~ I would like to mention a few observations regarding check fraud, the subject case number and the email trail below. 

Ideally, this check should have been returned prior to endorsing and depositing it into a Wells Fargo ( WF ) clients account that it was not intended for. 

When I first began to address this, I reached out to WF Customer Service. As Im not a client of WF, getting past robo-lady, without providing an account number to get to a representative, was next to impossible. ( WF did provide the clients account number/lock box on the the check that was fraudulently processed. I suppose this account number could be used, just to get past robo-lady, and get to a representative in the future ). In speaking with the WF fraud department and some other department, my concerns were deflected and dismissed. At no time did any representative I spoke with refer me to the complaint resolution team. After weeks of deflection I had to physically go into a WF and speak to a manager be provided with a course of action. This is when the resolution process was first brought to my attention. ( Note : When speaking with this manager, I said facetiously : What does it take?, ..should I go outside, call the police, report theft and state my funds are being held hostage? Imagine my surprise when their response was Actually, clients have called the police here for those reasons, that happens. That speaks volumes of some elusive WF Mission Statement ). 

This has been viewed as mistake, misapplied or error by WF without acknowledging the check fraud that was actually committed. 

I believe this is not a isolated incident. If there were to be a audit, it would reveal more of the same criminal activity that has been committed in the past. The fact that this was a Government check, intended for the Federal Reserve adds a element of concern. 

I find it interesting that not once were my specific questions answered specifically throughout. Nor was this addressed as I was assured it would be. When I originally called after the 10 day period, the Case Manager appeared to not know anything about it. In the conversation, XXXX ( XXXX ) was referred to as XXXX  by the representative. ( And who is XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX below ). In the XXXX XXXX, youll note as I did, that many of the responses were usually from one person XXXX, with XXXX being cc : d, yet the letters were signed by XXXX. I never really knew who I was ( effectively ) responding to. Also, in XXXX of the letters from/signed by XXXX, XXXX her sign off, XXXX : She/Her/Hers appears. While this may be trendy or au courant, like politics, personal preference really doesnt have any place in professional business correspondence. I have no doubt that as representatives of WF, and required process and procedures, they have no choice but to be puppets-on-a-string and can only be as effective as the leadership at the helm. Still, based on my experience, these resolution position ( s ) may not be a good fit for either of them. 

After the WF client brought this discrepancy to the attention of WF, WF pulled back the funds on Advice of Credit ~ Whatever that means. So where did the ( {$480.00} ) funds go? Is there a specific account for funds when WF commits check fraud? ( If so, see Audit above. That is probably where all the smoking guns are buried and more funds intended for the Government/Federal Reserve would be found ). 

Ironically, there was never any mention of interest, penalty, fines or administrative fees ( the latter for my leg work ) in payment adjustments. Did I expect any? No. Yet WF will not hesitate to incorporate all of the above toward their own clients for much less than what WF committed.

I would think, at this time, that WF would certainly have a handle on the domino effect of unethical business standards and practices. In just this saga alone, and my reliving it daily for two months ( while my health insurance went unpaid with the missing check ), I know of numerous WF clients I have relayed this issue to that have closed their accounts and/or 401k and chosen another financial institution with integrity for their banking needs. Will any of that break the bank? No, of course not. But I do know that it amounts to much more loss than the {$480.00} in question had it been addressed effectively, efficiently and ethically ~ and will continue to have the same continuous effect.

5/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"You will see that I have sent a previous complaint, but this is an extension of an ongoing issue I am having with Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2023 I was subject to fraud when I received a text message that was very similar to a previous fraud alert text from Wells Fargo, stating someone was trying to send money via XXXX from my account and asking if it was me. I called the phone number provided and the scammer repeated statements exactly the way a Wells Fargo customer service rep would have ( I know because it happened to me a few weeks earlier with my debit card being compromised ). The scammer was then able to obtain my information well enough to not only process this XXXX transaction but then also performed 3 wire transfers from my account totaling {$25000.00}. 

After my last claim with you was placed regarding the {$3500.00}, somehow Wells Fargo suddenly revoked their previous denial of my claim, "" did another investigation '', and refunded me the {$3500.00}. Unfortunately I am still missing {$15000.00} from two remaining wire transfers completed that were NOT performed with my authorization and Wells Fargo is refusing to refund or help me in any way. 

A couple weeks ago a small business Wells Fargo agent at a nearby branch asked me to come in to sign a form, stating they found some of my money at another bank and said if I signed the form they would release the money to Wells Fargo who would then release it to me. I went in and signed the form, the agent said I should receive between {$4000.00} and {$6000.00} back in my account within 2 weeks. This never happened. Ironically, the week after signing this form I got another call from the same agent at the nearby branch then stating that the information on the previous form was incorrect and I needed to sign a new one because some of my money was "" actually at a different bank ''. I went in and signed said form. It's been two weeks and yet nothing has happened. 

I presented to the same branch today to ask what the update was regarding the above and looking for answers, and they suddenly claimed they don't have any records of the above nor recent emails. They told me there is nothing in their control that they can do. Just leaving me hanging. So here I am again asking for your help. 

Wells Fargo already refunded 2 of the 4 transactions that all occurred withdrawing money from my accounts within the same day and within minutes of one another. If refunds were provided for 2 of the occurrences, why am I having to go through such a hassle to obtain the remaining 2? 

These transactions were never authorized by me. When I ask for investigative results from Wells Fargo as to what is guiding their decision making with my remaining claims, they will not provide such. I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for many years. I will again end my complaint with a statement made by the CFPB that suggests that if a consumer is fraudulently induced by a third party into sharing account access information that the consumer should receive the same protections as if the money were acquired from a stolen debit card or other banking access device, unfortunately Wells Fargo does not see things this way. I want my money completely out of Wells Fargo and do not trust them, yet here I am needing to keep an account open with them in the chance they eventually decide to give me my money back. I am a small business owner with a young family and this situation has been completely devastating for us. 

Thank you for your time and consideration to help me."
5/4/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"Hello- I would like to file a complaint against Wells Fargo for failing to stop a large amount of fraud and then failing to reimburse me for their mistakes. 
I was robbed on XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX XXXX ( see police report attached below ) and the thieves stole everything from me including my wallet with all my cards in it, jewelry and my phone- which the thieves got into. With my cards and my phone, they managed to get into my bank account and commit a series of obviously fraudulent transactions ( Wells Fargo processed 33 fraudulent transactions even though I called them on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to make sure they understood I was a victim of assault and theft and that my cards and accounts had been compromised. I simply don't know what else I could have reasonably done to protect myself in this situation. I repeatedly received multiple case numbers and when we spoke to XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo Rep ) on XX/XX/XXXX- he reassured me that all these transactions would absolutely be reimbursed. 

Obviously the reason I am writing to you is because not only did they not protect me from the fraud, even after they were notified of the theft- they now refuse to honor the commitment they made to reimburse me. 

This is wrong and I need your help in order to get Wells Fargo to do the right thing and return my own money to me. The total amount in dispute is {$5800.00}. The police report attached includes images of all the transactions I referenced above. 
It should also be mentioned that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX immediately took corrective action and made sure that I suffered no financial loss. 
It was only Wells Fargo that refused to do the right thing.

I again called the dealership to ask what was going on. They called Wells Fargo and then called me back to inform me Wells Fargo had misplaced the paperwork and I would have to redo the loan. So I had to go back to the dealership and resign the paperwork. I heard nothing from Wells Fargo no apology no sorry we screwed up just pay us or repossessing your van.

But I've see this claim before and that's the reason for the multiple complaints. Don't understand why this would get closed with out verifiable information that the company has followed through. Is the cfpb paid off by these big financial institutions to not actually investigate these wrong doings? Why have the cfpb if they are going to do anything and hold these institutions accountable. 
Complaint is opened so we can confirm the business does what they say. They didn't before. Actions speak louder than claims."

As we are waiting for our business accounts debit card to arrive, my wife and I took it upon ourselves to send {$300.00} to the personal account that we have had since XXXX, so that we could use that debit card to purchase tools.

I was then told that there was nothing that could be done because ( they ) werent sure if it was a fraudulent cashiers check, but had to make sure. From there I was told that the money that I needed to order cabinets for my refurbishment and pay my workers would not be available until the XXXX. 
Today being XX/XX/XXXX, I took a copy of the check, which Wells Fargo was graciously enough to give to me, and went to the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX where the check was made. My client the maker of the cashiers check also was gracious enough to not only give me a copy of his drivers license, but also a copy of the receipt for the cashiers check to prove that it wasnt fraudulent.

The lady helping us was super helpful and said ( and I can almost quote her, even after all these years, ) XXXX XXXX  I can move your payments out to XXXX XXXX and just move them to the end of the loan. We were ecstatic! About /around XXXX time we received paperwork for a forbearance. We did some research and made a few calls and it seemed it was a good thing via our calls to Wells Fargo. XXXX came and we received letters that our homeowners insurance lapsed and they ( Wells Fargo ) were going to place forced insurance on our payments of almost {$1200.00} a month. Of course we called and tried arranging some sort of alternative but, I couldnt find insurance that would insure me during a forbearance and I couldnt afford the new payment. 

Approximately XXXX XXXX, all finances were caught back up, but I could not fix our mortgage. We waited and tried a few lawyers, but, our efforts did not turn out well and we were foreclosed on in XXXX and the new owner demanded we move during XXXX withXXXX kids and XXXX foster kids. We declared bankruptcy, and that was finalized in XXXX ( ish ) that year. My facts my not be on an exact timeline. 

My belief is that if not for that rep misleading us to a forbearance, we could have handled the late payment and still have that beautiful home we wanted to retire in. 

I didnt know about the Wells Fargo settlement and the lawyers we spoke with back then told us our case was worthy, but we didnt have the finances to fight. Now in light of Wells Fargo I heard about we seem to fit that description."

I make car payments via check to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. For 4 1/2 years I have been mailing my car payments to XXXX on time and never had any issues. Until XX/XX/2023. 

I mailed check XXXX in the amount of {$600.00} on XX/XX/2023 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the funds were debited from XXXX account on XX/XX/2023. 

On XX/XX/2023 XXXX emailed me a statement stating that I was being charged a late payment and was still due my car payment. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to let them know I had mailed the payment in form of a check and that the check showed debited from my account and to please update their records. XXXX requested I forward a copy of front and back of the check. 

I requested the copies from Wells Fargo and received them via email. I then forwarded the copies to XXXX XXXX  via email that same day. I never received a reply but I did receive a voicemail on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to please contact them at their customer service number. I did this the same day and was told that XXXX is unable to locate the check in their system and therefore I was still owed the payment. I requested to get this in writing but the employee said they are not able to do so. However they would be willing to waive the late payment fee if I send in my outstanding payment. 

I then contacted Wells Fargo to inform them that XXXX stated they did not debit the funds and to please investigate who cashed the check and where the funds were sent. I was told the fraud department would be taking on this case and I should get a notification and status update on my online banking message center and vial mail. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received two letters from the Prevention Contact Center at Wells Fargo stating thatWells Fargo reviewed my accounts and as a result decided to close my accounts as of XX/XX/2023 and that they will not give any further explanation. 

I did not receive any communication whatsoever regarding the check XXXX and followed up with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that my claim was closed. I asked what the outcome was and why I did not receive any communication and was told I needed to talk to a claims specialist and that a letter was sent to me on XX/XX/2023. I stated I had not received the letter nor any online communication and to please let me know what the outcome was. The representative named XXXX said she would have to transfer me to a claims specialist. She did exactly that and that woman stated that the claim was now handled by the internal investigation department and I would be updated on the matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called the Prevention Contact Center number for Wells Fargo to investigate whether the closing of my accounts was related to the check incident and was told they could not answer that question. XXXX who I was speaking with was kind enough to hear my story and offered to assist me in finding out details on my check case. After 30 minutes of waiting time she told me she spoke with someone in the fraud department who told her the check was cashed and the funds were sent to a specific account number, I then asked if she could please name the bank that the account was at and she transferred me to the check fraud department where I spoke with a gentleman named XXXX in the XXXX. He then informed me that he was unable to access the any information related the account or routing number of the check. By my requested he transferred me to a "" specialist '' who heard my case and transferred me to the small business advocate XXXX. XXXX understood my concerns and promised to help and she patched in another claims specialist. His name was XXXX, he stated that he was not able to give me any information relating to the check incident and advised I should schedule and appointment with the branch manager at my local branch. 

I then received a letter from Wells Fargo including an affidavit on XX/XX/XXXX - the letter states it was mailed XX/XX/2023. I was asked to have the payee ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) sign and notarize this document stating they did not commit any fraudulent activity and did not cash the check. I had a total of 20 days to complete the affidavit from the day the letter was issued. 

I immediately called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was asked to please email the documents and the internal legal team was going to review them. I emailed the documents the same day. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX to please call them regarding this request. I did and was told they are unable to complete the affidavit. I then asked to please send me a letter or email stating that they did not receive the funds and was told they would review the request but it would take a minimum of 15 days for a reply and that it was unlikely they would issue this letter. 

I went to see my branch manager XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX she then referred me to their business specialist in the bank and he sat down with me to review the documents and also try and help. Unfortunately, he stated he could only print the front and copy of the check and file an internal complaint about this. He advised me to go to the police but he also agreed that Wells Fargo is obligated and should be able to give me the account number and routing number as to where my funds were sent. He said the internal complaint department would contact me and help me but it is now 48 hours later and I have not received anything. 

As you can see I have spent a lot of time, effort and energy in resolving the matter but neither Wells Fargo nor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have been of any assistance and I am at a standstill.

I was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and denied unemployment or workers comp inorder to keep my health insurance and have my medical bills paid. During all of this, for the past 4 years, I have constantly, consistently and purposefully remained in close contact with both WF & XXXX to request Mortage Forebearance and Mortgage Modification. I have begged them to settle with me for a discounted payoff. Over the 3 years, I have placed more than 50 phone calls and completed their forms and sustained constance abuse of both entities asking me to resubmit, stating they never received the applications, something was missing that they needed but they never told me. In late XXXX, after being blindsided with foreclosure papers from XXXX ( while I had been calling them weekly to learn if they'd accept a loan modification ), I was referred to Illinois Housing Assistance. I have submitted an application for financial yet they say they have reachecd out and need info from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo says they never received IHAF request. Conveniently, Wells Fargo has just sold my loan to XXXX and they say they haven't received any request from IHAF. However, everyday when I call IHAF to see if they can award me some support, they claim neither of the 3 creditors have responded and they will not accept the information from me. I have over 75 contact dates, phone numbers, case numbers. 
I have now just received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that the new loan agent of the Wells Fargo Mortgage, will begin foreclosure proceedings in 33 days from today. 
I can not explain the discrimination and abuse I have endured in trying to make ends meet and to not default by staying in constant contact and providing every single notice of doctors appointments, and medical records.

5/5/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Wells Fargo that there was fraud detection coming from my checking account. I checked, and saw that there were 8 transactions equating to {$630.00}. They include : 1- {$10.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) 2- {$7.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX {$46.00} ( XXXX  ) 4- {$120.00} ( XXXX ) 5- {$97.00} ( XXXX ) 6- {$20.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) 7- {$64.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) 8- {$260.00} ( XXXX  ) As soon as I saw these transactions were pending, which werent made by me, I immediately called the freud detection number provided on the email. The guy had me read out all of the amounts to him so he could file a claim, he deactivated my card, and said he was going to ship a new card to me. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX of the transactions got approved ( the XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ). Because of this, I called the bank again and asked why they got approved if my card was deactivated and they gave me {$64.00} back onto my account as card provision. The rest of the 6 amounts were under investigation. I then called the bank on XXXX  and asked for a status on my claim, and they said it was closed, yet they never sent an email or any notification. I asked why it was closed and if I would get my money back and they said my claim was denied. I went back and looked and saw that the one single purchase of {$7.00} at the pod market was actually me, but I wasnt aware that it got added to the claim, so because my card was chipped, accepted, and was in the hands of me when all of these transactions occurred, the bank denied my claim request because they said that I made a mistake of putting one of my actual purchases on the claim. While I do accept responsibility for mistakenly adding that purchase to the claim due to the fact that I was reading off all of the pending purchases to the man on the phone, this happening to be one of the pending purchase, I do not feel as though my entire claim should be denied, and that I should lose all of that money that was not spend by me. If they went in and investigated all of the other 7 transactions they would see that none of them were made by me."

Then, {$25000.00} was fraudulently wired from our checking account to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. The scammer was able to log into our account to enter in the beneficiary bank account details. I immediately called Wells Fargo to let them know the wire transfer was fraudulent and to place a fraud recall on the transfer. The Wells Fargo rep noted that "" I '' had called in earlier that day and verified that the wire transfer of $ XXXX into another account was for construction, but that call was not made by me, but rather by the scammer impersonating me. On XX/XX/XXXX, the day that the fraudulent activity was occurring on our account, Wells Fargo did not take enough action to verify the scammers identity to prevent the fraud from occurring. Additionally, the abnormal log-in from the scammers IP address should have been detected and flagged, since this could have prevented the $ XXXX fraudulent wire transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX, we opened XXXX fraud claims with Wells Fargo, XXXX for the fraudulent transfer of {$1000.00} from our savings to checking, and the other for the $ XXXX fraudulent transfer out of our checking account. We also opened a case number with the Wire Investigations Unit.

Since then, my spouse and I have spent hundreds of hours on the phone with Wells Fargo representatives from multiple departments including the ACH Check Fraud Department of the Claims Assistance Center, the Online Fraud Department, and the Wire Transfer Services Department. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargos Claims Assistance Center denying our claim for the $ XXXX fraudulent wire transfer. The letter states : "" As a courtesy, we initiated a wire recall on your behalf to attempt recovery of funds. Unfortunately, the beneficiary bank responded that there were no funds available to return. As a result, we are unable to reimburse you and have closed your claim. '' Wells Fargo is not doing their duty to help us retrieve the funds that were fraudulently wired from our account. Since XX/XX/XXXX, every representative my spouse and I have spoken to within Wells Fargos Wire Transfer Services Department has mentioned that we should be completing a Hold Harmless letter with our local banker, so that Wells Fargo can share this letter with XXXX XXXX XXXX to help us retrieve our funds. XXXX has told Wells Fargo that they can not attempt to recover the funds unless a Hold Harmless letter is provided, and Wells Fargo is failing to process this Hold Harmless letter in a timely manner. We've been in touch with the Wells Fargo Wire Transfer Services Department and the ACH Check Fraud Claims Assistance Center Department every week ( and on most weeks every day ) since XX/XX/XXXX, and our local Wells Fargo banker has as well. From XX/XX/XXXX onward, the wire transfer services department has been telling us that we need to complete a hold harmless letter, but the Fraud department in the Claims Assistance Center refuses to process this letter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I placed a second complaint with Wells Fargos Enterprise Complaints Management Office, requesting that a Hold Harmless letter be processed to recover the {$25000.00} that was fraudulently wired from our checking account to the XXXX XXXX XXXX account. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX finally responded to our complaint, with an unchanged resolution : that they would not be reimbursing the funds and that there is no specific timeframe for XXXX the hold harmless letter will be completed. 

It is unacceptable that XXXX XXXX XXXX requested the hold harmless letter back on XX/XX/XXXX, when our funds may have still had a chance of being recovered, and it is already XX/XX/XXXX and Wells Fargo has yet to cooperate with any of my, my spouses, or our bankers attempts to process and complete this Hold Harmless Letter in attempt to recover any funds that may be left in the scammers account. 

For clarity, my chief complaint is that Wells Fargo is failing in its duty to its protect customers and our money by : XXXX ) Failing to properly identify an individual impersonating me on the phone ; XXXX ) Failing to flag abnormal log-in attempts and failing to lock our account before the fraudulent $ XXXX transfer was made ; XXXX ) Failing to reimburse us for a $ XXXX fraudulent wire transfer that it was in the best position to prevent ; and 4 ) Failing to process a hold harmless letter in a timely manner to help us recover any funds that may be left."

XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX put a Power of Attorney on the record in XXXX saying they were my mother 's POA. How! She is dead? She had an executor and they usurped the executor. That is illegal! I am part of the XXXX XXXX XXXXr XXXX XXXX XXXX and am one of the original members whose land was listed in the public notice placed in the newspaper involving 87 other property owners. I am a member of FBI Case Number XXXX where it has been proven that all the banks are committing Mortgage Identity Theft and 5 other crimes when they foreclose on any property or land. Frankly, they steal, and you are allowing them to take our house, land, equity, title and leave us with nothing. When are you going to stop allowing these crimes to happen? Aren't the people paying your salaries? Don't you take an oath to protect the people? I am also part of the Department of Justice group action where they found the banks have in fact committed crimes and are in the process of paying out the money WELLS FARGO was ordered to pay for fraudulent practices. I am not the criminal here, WELLS FARGO has shown they consistently do criminal practices under XXXX XXXX, then Wachovia and now WELLS FARGO. Seems as though the government is oblivious to the crimes or are you a participant with them? XXXX owns thousands of acres, consolidating all properties under one umbrella and you are allowing it. Have you sold us out? Are you conspiring to kill the people and own all their assets? So sad that it has come to this! My grandmother is dead, she died in XXXX. Ask WELLS FARGO why they foreclosed against a dead woman? Why they brought her note from World Saving Bank that no longer existed because she was dead. I settled her note and the deed of assent says the property is owned fee simple. Yet you foreclosed against a dead woman in XXXX, when her estate was already settled. You lied to me many times, I settled with you again and you lied again. The Legal Notice you ran in the newspaper was against XXXX XXXX. If she did business with you, how did she? She was dead? You have no wet-ink signature. You are defaming my grandmother who was a civil rights leader who worked in the community for 50 years, be careful of how you destroy her name sir! I am so tired of explaining to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and others. WELLS FARGO conspires with these companies to commit fraud because they have been provided settlement, have discharged and have been provided settlement again. Since lying WELLS FARGO employees want 60 days to investigate something they have investigated many times in the past, according to the Fair Debt Collection Act they are supposed to take the disputed item off the credit report while they investigate. I guess WELLS FARGO makes the rules, I guess they don't have to follow the law, I guess XXXX money can buy you anything! When are you going to stop WELLS FARGO from damaging the people! They have killed me in commerce, financially slaughtered my character, economically held me XXXX until I have suffocated and now my vessel in commerce is dead. How am I supposed to live? I am a living woman who has the same right to live in peace on my own land but WELLS FARGO continues their deceitful tactics and their conspirators XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX help them perpetuate the fraud. According to United States Code Title 15 Subsection 1601-1666 Pertains to WELLS FARGO 's bad banking practices. Consumer Law - 15 USC 1602 ( I ) Credit Card - used my Social Security Card as funding to pull credit, so what has WELLS FARGO lost? They are liars! Truth in Lending 15 U S Code 1605 Determination of Finance Charge ( what they aren't telling you ) - Finance charges should be provided separate from the rest of the document, but you WELLS FARGO loves small print and comingles all the charges together. ANY transactions that I have ever done with WELLS FARGO have been settled many times over plus when I had my business account their they got full benefits for the income I put in the bank from the business. They kept title to the securities deposited because according to their records the securities were abandoned. If the public school system and universities trained us to operate in commerce we would know and America would not be on the verge of finance collapse! This is WELLS FARGO and their gang of banking criminals ' fault!"

We set up automatic payments of {$310.00} a month, knowing that we would have to send additional payments prior to the deadline. We never missed a payment. A few months before the deadline we made XXXX additional payments of {$1500.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ), {$500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$620.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. We also set up extra payments for XXXX and XXXX for {$310.00}. Just to be sure we were covered I sent an extra {$3.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

So imagine our surprise in XXXX of XXXX when we saw a charge for {$310.00} come through our bank app. I called and found out that Wells Fargo did not take the extra XXXX autopayments of {$310.00} because they said their system only accepts minimum payments so they did not process the XXXX extra auto payments. 

Because their system did not accept the payments, they were charging us {$3600.00} in back interest. 

I opened a complaint and they are agreeing to waive {$1700.00} if we pay {$1800.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. 

I consulted a lawyer who advised that I pay the balance because Wells Fargo is famous for messing up people 's credit. I have had an XXXX credit rating for several years. WE paid on-time the whole duration of our agreement and made a good faith effort to pay the balance. Wells Fargo 's website is very misleading."

The bank didn't stop the fraud and put the payments through. I told them I have never used these things and don't even know how to. They could check my past records and see I had not. Since this hack was done on my account I filed several appeals but was denied that I had either done this or had someone do it..

I had to call social security with new account information.

I truly did not do this or allow it to happen. I am a senior citizen that has to have my monthly Social Security check to survive. 

So to sum this up why would I put myself through all this if I purposely gave money. 
away. The last letter I received from the bank was dated XX/XX/XXXX ( only 5 working days later ) so they made their decision very quickly. This letter states that {$500.00} is my responsibility. This is quite unfair especially since I called at once to the bank asking them not to process the transactions while they were pending.

5/5/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"I received a phishing email from service XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX saying invoice updated amount due {$390.00} to cancel or get a refund called number XXXX XXXX I called as I did not make any transaction but it was a scam. I was asked to download XXXX app to get my refund. Through that app they make me transfer money from my savings to checking but I did not notice. I was asked to check my bank account and I found a credit {$39000.00}. I was shocked, panicked and shaking. Through the app when you type {$390.00} the dot does not work and the amount will be {$39000.00}. On purpose the scammer will guide you during the refund process and asked to type {$390.00} After that incident they told me that I have refunded myself unduly and knowing that I am a honest person I will return the money. I was told to go to the bank and wire the difference {$38000.00} which I did. 
When I returned home I had a bad feeling that it was scam. I immediately called the bank to stop the wire. I was told that I have to go back to the bank to recall it. I drove back to the bank and the banker recalled the wire. The banker said he dont know when I will get refunded no timeframe no guarantee but the bank will contact the beneficiary bank. 
My bank is Wells Fargo and beneficiary bank is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I have been going back and forth to WF to get my refund. Feedback from WF is that XXXX is not responding to any messages. As at today I still did not get my money back. I filed a complaint on XXXX website on XX/XX/XXXX and they replied on XX/XX/XXXX acknowledging that they have received my complaint. In short they said that they are an intermediate and the beneficiary account belongs to XXXX. In the same email XXXX responded too they mentioned that WF should contact XXXX directly via XXXX with a hold harmless letter. 
I went to WF XX/XX/XXXX and forwarded that letter to the banker but it looked like the letter is USELESS. Nothing change. 
I was out of country from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX so no follow up to my case. 
When I came back I went to WF on XX/XX/XXXX and I officially received a reply from WF on XX/XX/XXXX where it says that WF has contacted Beneficiary bank on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX but the beneficiary bank did not acknowledge to any messages. Please consider your claim as closed. So the letter that I received on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX and that I forwarded XXXX times to the bankers ( each time I visit its a different banker ) is not of any concern to WF. 
As I did not get any help & support from WF I sent an email to XXXX but I received an automated reply saying -if I am a customer please use in-chat app -if I am not a customer please direct your case to your bank and request your bank to contact us. I am desperate WF has closed my claim who should I see to get help. I also filed a complaint on FBI internet crime complaint center and FTC. After filing FTC I found out that I can also file a complaint on consumer finance.gov. So I just filed my complaint. 
Looking forward to hearing from you"

5/6/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was returning home to California from a trip to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX My husband and I stopped at a gas station near the airport before returning the rental car. I tried to use my Wells Fargo American Express credit card for the purchase. There was a gas station attendant that took my card for payment. He had a handheld card reader and tried running the card multiple times. He said the internet wasn't working well and couldn't get the card to go through, then asked for another form of payment. I was feeling nervous as a few people were hanging around the car and seemed to be trying to distract my husband as I paid. I decided to use cash to pay for gas ( estimated about {$40.00} ) so we could leave quickly. I was given my card back, but was not given a receipt and I DID NOT sign anything. 

After returning home and checking my account I found 4 fraudulent charges on my account. Each charge was for appx {$990.00} US and for a company I have never heard of or done business with. I immediately called Wells Fargo and reported the fraudulent transactions. Since I still had my card with me and I understood how the fraud was committed, I was told I could keep my card open if I wanted. 

In XXXX Wells Fargo reversed appx {$950.00} on 3 of the transactions ( supposedly they deducted {$40.00} dollars from each of these transactions that I estimated I paid in cash for the gas ) and the 4th transaction they rec 'd a merchant receipt so they have denied that dispute. This resolution makes no sense. Why would I have paid for gas 4 times? {$40.00} 3 times and then an additional {$990.00}? I have escalated within Wells Fargo complaints department and Executive Office and each time my dispute is denied. I was told that the original claim was processed as "" non-Fraud '' and as a partial claim. They have fundamentally misunderstood and mishandled the claim. This should never have been processed as a partial claim and I should have been advised to close and destroy my card. The transactions were obviously not for Gas. 

Wells received a merchant receipt from XXXX XXXX and therefore they are claiming that the purchase was legitimate, but the receipt was from a merchant in XXXX ( I was not there ), and I can not find the merchant or even the address existing online. The signature appears as a squiggle and certainly not my signature. Wells Fargo claims that I have not provided PROOF which contradicts the merchant evidence. I have not been advised on what proof they would need to honor my claim, they simply listen to my complaint, and send it off again to another department. 

What I can provide here is the following. 
1. My letter to the Executive office with a full explanation of the situation, including where I was at the time of the incident, signed by me 2. My Car rental and airline receipt showing that I was leaving XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and traveling back on that day. 
3. The fake receipt from the merchant "" XXXX XXXX '' The time stamp is correct, our flight departed at XXXX and we were getting gas at the airport prior to departure, but we were in XXXX  ( not XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 4. I do not believe this is a legitimate merchant as there is no listing for XXXX XXXX, and the address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX does not appear to be an actual address. What was purchased? What is XXXX XXXX? No one from Wells Fargo has talked to me about these details. Only to say, They have an itemized doc with transaction details and a signature so case closed. 
5. That is not my signature. I have 3 business accounts and 6 credit cards with Wells fargo, all my Wells Fargo contracts are signed in the same way, they can verify my signature in any number of ways. This is an obvious fake signature."

I did manage to have a representative open a new account and try to secure my account from all the fraud that was happening. But it wasn't until the second time that I called to do a follow-up that this happened. 

The original first time I called to report the transactions the representative told me I am creating a new account for you right now gave me a number to save as my account number and when I called for updates and gave the second representative the account number that number didn't exist for me. At this point the second representative did help set me up with a new account and took all my statement over and basically start from XXXX to complie all the information required for the claim. 

I made it my mission to stay updated with what was happening with my account by calling in at least once a week. 
When I called Wells Fargo about the transaction there was an active case that I would call to inquire more information about at least once a week since the transactions. The last I spoke with a Wells Fargo representative was in XXXX of XXXX that someone would get ahold of me to discuss things further and I didn't have to keep on calling them every week.

I called the bank waited on hold for 15 minutes. I reached XXXX on the line who repeated his name and that he was on a recorded line 4 times which is probably why they have 15 minute hold times. My wife was also on the line since she was stranded at the gas station. We were told XXXX was unable to clear the fraud block because their system was updating. we expressed our frustration due to my wife, being stranded in the middle of the night with our children. XXXX was too sensitive to handle the complaints and instead disconnected the call stating he did not want to deal with the negative interaction. My two complaints are that if their system is updating, they need to have a workaround to remove a block they placed on my account and secondly, if I share a complaint, it should be logged and I should not be hung up on. This needs to be escalated to Wells Fargo management. If this is how theyre going to do business, I will terminate my business with them."

5/7/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Greetings, This is in reference to several complaints that I filed against Wells Fargo to include the recent complaint filed under XXXX. 

I recently received an XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  dated letter from Wells Fargo stating "" during a review of the account, we identified that when we considered the account for a deferral review, an issue occurred. '' Wells Fargo included with the dated letter a check for {$1700.00}. They also mentioned in the letter for any inconvenience this may have caused. 

Any inconvenience??? 

I lost my home because of Wells Fargo 's unethical, illegal, and discriminatory mortgage practices! 

I was proactive and reached out to Wells Fargo on several occasions PRIOR TO and DURING COVID for assistance. I repeatedly pleaded for Wells Fargo to offer me a loan modification and a refinance to keep my family home. 

Wells Fargo refused to help me, a 21-plus years XXXX XXXX and PERMANENTLY XXXX MILITARY VETERAN, because of the color of my skin! 

Instead, Wells Fargo initiated foreclosure proceedings on XX/XX/XXXX and ruined my credit rating. 

I was FORCED to sell my family home. It was a TREMENDOUS loss emotionally, physically, and financially. 

Wells Fargo kept making previous comments that they did not do anything wrong despite my many documented complaints about their mortgage practices. 

Wells Fargo harmed me and my family and is still harming me and my family by sending a check for {$1700.00} for what they call an inconvenience!!! 

This is extremely insulting and insensitive! 

My complaints ( and the plethora of complaints from others ) is well founded! 

The {$1700.00} is nowhere near the compensation that is due to me and my family for Wells Fargo 's deplorable actions! 

Furthermore, I have not received any other payment from Wells Fargo despite what is reflected in the XX/XX/XXXX dated letter. 

CFPB, I implore you to help me with this matter."

It took over 4 account specialists and 2 months for the money to be released. 
After illegally accepting the wire transfer to The XXXX XXXX XXXX in my mother 's personal checking, they claimed the proceeds of the sale of the condo ( for which they held the mortgage ) had to go through probate.

During this period my brother and his wife threatened me, reported me to authorities as illegally withholding inheritance from them, and asking friends to come after me to get their money. 
I suffered incredible emotional harm, and wells Fargo made it all worse. It took months for them to resolve the issue - and all I asked them to do was reject the wire transfer and return the money to escrow. I didn't even ask them to release it to me- just send it back to the people who had sent it. 
This was within a year of my mother 's death, and compounded with my grief and other responsibilities as executor, I was deeply traumatized by my experience. To this day, my XXXX child sees a wells Fargo sign and hisses saying "" they hurt my mom ''."

Because of this I could only pay by walking in to the bank or mailing a check. 
I then was behind a payment for 30 days but under 60 and a man showed up at my apartment looking for me.

Home was ran in NEWS PAPER AS A FOR-CLOSURE accidentally, they said it was an accident. 
Being well known in the community, there was talk of my financial situation at the court house with attorneys discussing the foreclosure listed in the local NEWSPAPER, what an embarrassment. 

I paid a lump sum after a modification & the lump sum was added to the rear of the loan, not as a lump sum payment option, even though my mortgage statement showed the amount due to date, the formula they used didnt go with the statement they sent out.. it clearly said the amount due was owed but they changed it & they added 3 years to the loan. Even though my maturity date said XXXX they then changed till XXXX, made no since to get penalized for a CIVIL RELIEF ACT program 3 years of {$1200.00} payments, {$43000.00} So were the programs they lure you in with even the ones that the government let them offer?

When i went into my Wells Fargo mobile app to deposit said check, my account got flagged for fruad due and my account will be in foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX because the check did not having my name on it. 
( even though it was in the memo ) I go into a branch and stated all i needed to do is submit documents from my employer stating is was a mistake on there part.

Wells Fargo said that wouldnt be enough and would need it as a letterhead indicating numbers of how much do payment of the deposit was. 

My HR lady submitted another updated document Wells Fargo said that wouldnt be enough and would a phone number register with the business to verify this accident. 

My HR lady submitted another updated document with both her personal/ business phone number Wells Fargo stated neither numbers would verify me. 

I continued to escalate this issue to the fraud prevention department/loss prevention in hopes of speaking with someone that would be able to unflag my account. I spoke with a Manager representative. Her name was XXXX and she stated that as long as the {$1900.00} falls off of my account due my account would be in good standing. She also stated she understood that this issue was base on the fact that my employer is a work from home business that does not have a main office. My employer voided and did a stop payment on the {$1900.00} third-party check and when I called in to verify why the {$1900.00} hasnt fell off of my account they told me that I had to wait for information from third-party bank to verify that the check had been voided. 
Even though a previous representative had already verified, that information has been sent to Wells Fargo. 
Gave me a hassle on not giving me the option to let my HR lady be on the call to verify herself over the phone. 
Even though a previous representative stated that it was OK if I had her on the line to speak to the loss prevention department. 
After speaking to a manager in the loss prevention department, he stated they only would except a phone number from the CEO of my employer and two pieces of identification as well as two pieces of identification of my own to verify that this is a was a mistake on my employers behalf.

This company has been violating me for the past 6 months, despite me having a paid lawyer, and calling me personally even though they are aware of my attorney 's presence. This is a clear violation of the laws that are in place to protect me as a consumer. 

I am tired of the harassment that I have been dealing with, and it seems like nobody has considered my safety, time, money, or health in this matter. This is unacceptable and shows a complete lack of respect for the laws that are in place to protect consumers like me. I should not have to live in fear. 

When Wells Fargo called me not even 10 minutes after my complaint was sent, it caused me more stress and anxiety. It also let me know that they have no intentions of doing the right thing. I am asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to step in and do what is fair according to their laws. 

I would like to be compensated under the laws provided to me. This company needs to be held accountable for their actions, and I am confident that the CFPB will do what is necessary to ensure that justice is served. I urge you to take swift action against this company and ensure that they are held accountable for their actions. 

I have to stand up for myself when I know that a fraud has been committed against me. I will not pay for something that was gained by deception, deceitful tactics, harassment, nor fraud. Im asking for your help. 


Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
5/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"On XX/XX/2023, I was made aware a checked had been posted to my Wells Fargo checking account in the amount of {$1000.00}. A scanned image of the check available online through Wells Fargo 's website revealed the following problems : the check did not appear to look like my checks and the signature was clearly a forged signature. I reported the check as fraudulent using Wells Fargo online banking, and I called the phone number indicated on the website to report a fraudulent check. 

Upon speaking to the Wells Fargo representative, I reported the check was not drawn by me, and was a fraudulent, forged check. I was made aware by this representative that the check had an incorrect routing number -- something that was redacted or otherwise cut out of view from my view on Wells Fargo 's online banking 's image of the check. The representative agreed with me that the signature did not appear to be mine -- after acknowledging she could see images of other checks I could confirm as legitimate. She further acknowledged the check itself did not look at all like my other checks, and she agreed the Wells Fargo graphic appeared to be suspicious. She further acknowledged that the check number was non-sequential with the other checks I had recently drawn on the account. 

After confirming she did no have the authority to expedite my request, I spoke with numerous other representatives who confirmed with me a claim had been opened and expedited to investigate the reported fraudulent, forged check. I was given no other assurances but the bank would respond within ten ( 10 ) business days. 

Approximately one week passed, and during said time I received no written correspondences from the bank notifying me a claim had been set up or other communications. I thereafter called the bank, and they confirmed a claim was set up for the purposes of investigating my report of a fraudulent, forged check. I asked for a status of the bank 's investigation and its findings, and When I demanded an explanation, I was informed by the Wells Fargo representative that such matters were privileged and protected information which could not be disclosed. 

Notwithstanding this, On XX/XX/2023, I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/2023, informing me that Wells Fargo had determined the transaction was "" posted correctly '' and the claim would be closed. There was no further explanation or justification for the bank 's decision. 

On that same day -- today -- I called the number indicated in the letter ( XXXX ). I indicated I was taking issue with the bank 's disposition, and I requested an explanation of the bank 's decision and the findings of that investigation. I was connected with a Senior Resolution Specialist within Wells Fargo 's claims department who informed me the bank had mistakenly coded or other inputted the claim as a non-fraud claim. When asked the basis and reason for this, the Specialist informed me I had reported the claim as a problem with the routing number. I informed him this was information unknown to me at the time I discovered the fraudulent check, and that I had only been made aware of the incorrect routing number by the initial Wells Fargo representative I spoke with. I requested to speak to someone with more managerial authority, but I was informed the only assurance I could be given was that a new claim had been set up, and I could only expect to receive a response via US mail within ten ( 10 ) additional business days. 

If there ever were an instance of a bank 's malfeasance and negligence in the handling of one of its depositor 's accounts, this is one."
5/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,I was contacted by what I thought was a remote job from XXXX. They claimed to be XXXXXXXX XXXX  and used the name XXXX XXXX. They sent me a check in the mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to be used to purchase work materials for the amount of {$4900.00}. Upon depositing the check into my Wells Fargo account on XX/XX/2023 they began asking to send the money to different places and the check was found to be fraudulent and now my account is negative that amount and I do not have the money to pay this back. This was a scam and I should not have to pay this.
5/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,There weee many last year every month they took XXXX many times
5/9/23,Mortgage,VA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Regarding home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX To whom it my Concern : I am writing this letter to explain the series of events that cause my home to be foreclosed on. I purchased my home in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I took out a 30 year fixed rate mortgage in which my payment was around {$650.00}. In the end of XXXX Wells Fargo raised my payment to {$1200.00} per month without justification. 



I had an auto draft payment on my back account for my Mortgage and Well Fargo withdrew the {$1200.00} payments until it had completely depleted the {$7500.00} I had in that account. I spent over 150 Hours on the phone over the course of several months trying to get a justification for why my payment had gone up so much. I was normally transfers back and forth between sections up to 9 times per attempt. I was eventually told it was an issue with my escrow. I then went and got copies of my tax records as well as my property insurance policy. I then sent it to Wells Fargo at least 10 times which clearly stated that my payment was unjustly raised.

I finally got a hold of a representative at Wells Fargo that told me that that my best option was not to worry about the increase in payment. I was then told that I would most likely qualified for the HARP refinancing programs and that was my best option to prevent Foreclosure. I completed all the required forms and sent them in 6 different times. I made dozens of follow up calls and was told that the process took time. During this time I looked into trying to sell the house but the resident of the home next to me had died and after they inspected the neighboring home interior the home became condemned. So it became impossible to sell my house with a large condemned sign on my neighbors home. The whole time I was making the payment that I could. After over 6 months of trying to get the situation resolved Wells Fargo told me that I still owe them an additional {$4500.00} and that they would not except anything but the full amount. I didnt possess the fund to pay them and my home was then foreclosed on in XXXX."
5/9/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I kept getting overdrafts for no reason, so I would have to transfer money to my checking account from a XXXX or XXXX.

They transferred my savings into another account in correct amount. I thought I was safe. The next day the transfer went through. This amount put me well over the actual limit that is allowed for the mos. I believe a Wells Fargo employee could be involved with this.

I began paying my rent with the card but also use it for some other general purchases from time to time. For the past two months I attempt to pay a maximum on the credit card which Ive learned is not directly linked to Wells Fargo. The lag in applying my payments through my non Wells Fargo linked bank account is causing my rent payment to go past due. Secondly, the card has a feature that if activated, will pull funds directly from my bank account. I made a XXXX payment to the card on XX/XX/23 from my bank account and there is no activity to reflect the available balance on the card to apply the rent payment without directly pulling the funds from a linked bank account. If you attempt to contact XXXX they direct you to Wells Fargo and vice versa. Im paying an enormous apr on the card now on top of being hit with late fees from the lag in processing the payments.

Wells Fargo has showed how classless it actually is. this is the 5th complaint on the same issue and the bank refuses to take responsibility for the dispute that is entirely its fault. why do I have to jump through hoops to prove my innocence on the back of a security breakdown of the bank. I have been through so much with my family and countless hardships due to the lack of compassion on the banks part and my family has been put in jeopardy because of it. ive done exactly as I was asked by all parties involved and still as a loyal customer of 20 years, am being asked to eat everything I have in all my accounts combined and the banks has not even offered as much as a XXXX of compensation.

5/10/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"1 ) Pursuant to CPLR 3408 WELLS FARGO did NOT Negotiate a Mortgage Modification in Good Faith. 
2 ) Pursuant to CPLR 3408 WELLS FARGO improperly Denied me a Mortgage Modification when as Per Wells Fargos own NPV Document shows I qualify at 30 % and within HAMP Guidelines. ( NPV Document attached ) 3 ) WELLS FARGO failed to follow Investors Service Agreement that DOES ALLOW MORTGAGE MODIFICATIONS. ( I have the PSA and attached relevant parts ) 4 ) WELLS FARGO Failed to provide a Modification in my XX/XX/XXXX Application under CPLR 3408 when in Wells Fargos NPV Document Proves Im within HAMP Guidelines at 30 % but Wells Fargo incorrectly denied me and stated it was over 42 %. In my complaint with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and in phone conversations with Wells Fargo Representatives on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I asked for a documentation Wells Fargo used in coming up with my income was over 42 %, but to date Wells Fargo has ignored every request in violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ). 
XXXX ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ) IF A LENDER HAS DENIED THE APPLICATION, THE FOLLOWING IS REQUIRED ( REQUIRED ) : 1 ). DENIAL LETTER GIVING THE DATA INPUT FIELDS AND VALUES USED IN THE EVALUATION.

6 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of CFR 1024.41 ( d ) ( 2 ) - Loss Mitigation Procedures- ( d ) Denial of loan modification options : 2 ) NET PRESENT VALUE CALCULATIION ( NPV ). If a trial or permanent loan modification is denied because of a net present value calculation, THE SPECIFIC REASONS IN THE NOTICE PROVIDED TO THE BORROWER MUST INCLUDE THE INPUTS USED IN THE NET PRESENT VALUE ( NPV ) CALCULATUION. In Wells Fargos Denial of my XX/XX/XXXX Modification Application just stated PROPOSED MODIFICATION MONTHLY PAYMENT AMOUNT WOULD BE MORE THAN 42 % OF GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. My Attorney responded with the NPV inputs telling Wells Fargo their calculations were inaccurate and to recalculate but they denied it again with the same answer. In the denial, WELLS FARGO never included THE INPUTS USED IN THE NET PRESENT VALUE ( NPV ) CALCULATUION which they MUST include and in Violation of CFR 1024.41 ( d ) ( 2 ).

7 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section 6.5 If as Wells Fargo Claims, investor does not participate in program why did Wells Fargo perform an NPV? HAMP Section 6.5 states - If the SERVICER IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT MAKE IT UNFEASIBLE TO COMPLETE THE MODIFICATION waterfall steps, the SERVICER SHOULD IDENTIFY THIS PRIOR ( PRIOR ) TO PREFORMING THE NPV EVALUATION and NOT PREFORM AN NPV EVALUATION.

8 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of HAMP Section 6.5 by having me Apply for a HAMP Modification and Wells Fargo preforming the NPV evaluation if the Investor has restrictions. WELLS FARGO is also In Violation of APPELLATE COURT Ruling APPELLATE DIVISION, SECOND DEPARTMENT, NEW YORK U.S. Bank Nat. Ass'n v. Smith , 123 AD3d 914 Dec. 17, XXXX. If the servicer is subject to restrictions that make it unfeasible to complete the modification waterfall steps, the servicer should identify this PRIOR TO PERFORMING THE NPV EVAUATION and NOT PERFORM an NPV evaluation.

9 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of CFR 1024.41 ( d ) ( 1 ) - Loss Mitigation Procedures- ( d ) Denial of loan modification options : 1 ) Investor requirements. If a trial or permanent LOAN MODIFICATION OPTION IS DENIED BECAUSE OF A REQUIREMENT OF AN OWNER OR ASSIGNEE of a mortgage loan, THE SPECIFIC REASON ( SPECIFIC REASON ) IN THE NOTICE PROVIDED TO THE BORROWER MUST ( MUST ) IDENTIFY the owner or assignee of the mortgage loan and THE REQUIREMENT THAT IS THE BASIS OF THE DENIAL. A STATEMENT THAT THE DENIAL OF A LOAN MODIFICATION OPTION IS BASED ON AN INVESTORS REQUIREMENT WITHOUT ( WITHOUT ) ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SPECIFFICALLY IDENTIFYING ( SPECIFFICALLY IDENTIFYING ) THE RELEVANT INVESTOR AND THE SPECIFIC APPLICATION REQUIREMENT IS INSUFFICIENT. In my 2nd Modification Application XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Denied me based on investor does not participate in program WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. Wells Fargo Never provided THE SPECIFIC REASON. Wells Fargo Notice never SPECIFFICALLY IDENTIFYING THE RELEVANT INVESTOR. Wells Fargo failed to provide THE REQUIREMENT THAT IS THE BASIS OF THE DENIAL. 

10 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section - 1.3 Investor Solicitation Wells Fargo had the Duty to review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP. Since Wells Fargo is claiming after my 2nd modification application the investor does not participate in program they are in Violation of HAMP 1.3.

11 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section - 1.3 Investor Solicitation - WELLS FARGO FAILED to contact the investor in writing asking for a Waiver.

12 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section - 1.3 in As per APPELLATE DIVISION, SECOND DEPARTMENT, NEW YORK. CITIMORTGAGE INC v. LOFRIA. Since the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it followed HAMP regulations and guidelines, i.e., that it MADE ANY EFFORT AT ALL TO SEEK A WAIVER FROM THE as to the restriction which made it unfeasible to complete the modification waterfall steps, it FAILED to establish that it NEGOIATED IN GOOD FAITH pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ). Also in the COURT OF APPEALS ( listed later in complaint ), WELLS FARGO FAILING TO PROVIDE A WAIVER OF THE INVESTOR RESTRICTIONS DEMOSTRATES A FAILURE TO FOLLOW HAMP GUIDELINES WHICH CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO NEGOIATE IN GOOD FAITH PRUSUANT TO CPLR 3408 ( f ).

13 ) WELLS FARGO In violation of HAMP Section 7.0 Net Present Value ( NPV ) - Testing All loans that meet HAMP eligibility criteria. ( 1 ) Using the standard modification waterfall, THE RESULTS IS DEEMED POSITIVE AND THE SERVICER MUST ( MUST ) OFFER A MODIFICATION.

In WELLLS FARGOS NPV Document in my 1st Application XX/XX/XXXX it proves a POSTIVE result with me at 30 % and in HAMP Guidelines yet Wells Fargo Declined me in Violation of HAMP Section 7.0.

14 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ). I Requested from Wells Fargo multiple times for a copy of the Investors PSA for my review to see the servicing Rules, Restrictions or Prohibitions. Wells Fargo Response XX/XX/XXXX Weve completed our review of your request for pooling and servicing agreements and a copy of the investor restrictions used in the modification review. Due to the items being confidential, privileged and/or proprietary information, were unable to provide the information requested. Per CPLR 3408 ( e ) if borrower is denied based on investors restrictions they are required to provide EVIDENCE of the PSA. Wells Fargo in Violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ) IF A LENDER HAS DENIED THE APPLICATION, THE FOLLOWING IS REQUIRED ( REQUIRED ) : 2 ). IF DENIAL WAS BASED ON INVESTOR RESTRICTIONS, EVIDENCE SUCH AS A POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT.

15 ) WELLS FARGO is also In Violation of XXXX COURT RULINGS by not providing the PSA as ruled in XXXX SUPREME COURT ( bellow ) the plaintiff must provided the PSA with Documentary evidence of the restrictions. Supreme Court of NYS Bank of Am., N.A . v Rausher 2014 - A plaintiff who contends that it can not agree to a loan modification or other arrangement that would allow a defendant to stay in his home because of an "" investor '' prohibition or restriction must ( MUST ) provide the court with suitable documentary evidence of the restriction Clearly, plaintiff 's refusal to even consider the defendant 's loan modification has violated its obligation to negotiate in good faith pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ).

16 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of the HEARSAY RULE. Wells Fargo just stating Investor does not participate in the program without any evidence or documentation, Falls under NYS and FEDERAL RULES of HEARSAY under FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE RULE 801 ( C ) HEARSAY, RULE 802, RULE 803 ( 7 ) ( 15 ) all listed at the end of this complaint.

17 ) WELLS FARGOs statement Investor does not participate in the program is False and Untrue. I obtained a copy of the investors Prospective Pooling Service Agreement ( see attached document ) and it States ( in part ) that "" the Servicer ( Wells Fargo N.A. ) Under SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS, Modifications, will be permitted to modify, wave or amend any term if such mortgage loan ''.

18 ) I have documentation between my attorney and Wells Fargos Mediation Specialist ( attorney ) requesting Wells Fargo to reconsider the Mortgage Denial, but that also got denied. Why would Wells Fargos own Mediation Specialist ( as Wells Fargos describes attorney handling settlement conferences ) ask them to reconsider my CPLR 3408 HAMP Modification? Because the Mediation Specialist agreed that I qualified for a Mortgage Modification! 
Wells Fargo also in Violation of XXXX Court Ruling, "" Supreme Court of XXXX Bank of Am., N.A . v Rausher 2014 - A plaintiff who contends that it can not agree to a loan modification or other arrangement that would allow a defendant to stay in his home because of an "" investor '' prohibition or restriction must provide the court with suitable documentary evidence of the restriction '' Clearly, plaintiff 's refusal to even consider the defendant 's loan modification has violated its obligation to negotiate in good faith pursuant to CPLR 3408 ( f ).

In 2013 Wells Fargo filled out and presented to my Attorneys and myself an NPV document for my March 2013 Application, showing my monthly income, mortgage taxes and insurance, Principal and interest payment of the Proposed HAMP modification, a revised interest rate of 2 % and a mortgage term from 360 months to 480 months. According to HAMP Section 7 loans that meet the applicable HAMP eligibility criteria in Section 1 must be evaluated using a standardized NPV test so Wells Fargo determined that I was eligible for a HAMP Modification and in so determining went to the next step and filled out the NPV document. How can Wells Fargo determine my Qualification or fill out the NPV if the Investor does not Participate? It has already been stated in Section 1.3 that Wells Fargo should had determine investor participation in HAMP and Section 6.5 and XXXX APPELLATE COURT that Wells Fargo should not fill out a NPV Document if investor does not participate. 
My Complaint against Wells Fargo which they continually fail to properly answer and/or truthy and hide behind false statements. 1 ) Most recent complaint filed XX/XX/XXXX and answered by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. Complaint stated a ) Wells Fargo per CPLR 3408 with my XX/XX/XXXX modification, failed to modify my mortgage. When using XXXX Document Wells Fargo Provided, It proves Im at 30 % and within HAMP Guidelines, but Wells Fargo incorrectly stated I was over 42 %. I have asked Wells Fargo to show the Math they used per CPLR 3408 ( e ) in coming up that Im over 42 %. Using Wells Fargos NPV Document proves Wells Fargos Software error caused an Improper Denial. 
In My second Modification Submittal XX/XX/XXXX, I entered a correction in income where my monthly income substantially increased and would have lowered my monthly income to around 24 % Well within HAMP Guidelines. Conveniently this time Wells Fargo Stated Investor does not participate in the program. Wells Fargo also stated my Monthly income was insufficient? I have asked Wells Fargo for a copy of the Investors POOLING SERVICE AGREEMENT ( PSA ) explaining all Rules, Restrictions or Preclusions. Wells Fargo on 5/3/23 answered requested are considered confidential, privileged and/or proprietary information of Wells Fargo . FIRST, any information perinate to my mortgage must be disclosed to me. SECOND, by Wells Fargo just stating Investor does not participate in the program Falls under NYS and FEDERAL RULES of HEARSAY under FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE RULE 801 ( C ) HEARSAY, RULE 802, RULE 803 ( 7 ) ( 15 ) all listed at the end of this complaint. If Wells Fargo makes a Claim based on a Document, they must submit the Document. Also, if an Attorney request the PSA, it must be given, I am acting here Pro Se and as such I requested the document 3 times but still have been denied. THIRD, a PSA is filed with the SEC and is a public Document. I Have looked up and found the INVESTORS PSA DOCUMENT on the SEC Website ( relevant parts listed at the end of this document ). The Document - PSA ( Prospective ) filed ; XXXX XXXX XXXX Company - XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX COLLATERALIZED ASSET-BACKED BONDS, SERIES XXXX THE TRUST. Company - XXXX XXXX XXXX Indenture Trustee - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX It lists ; Subservicer - WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.. The Perinate Points of this Prospective PSA Document States TABLE OF CONTENTS - Servicing of Mortgage Loans - Page 14. MODIFICATIONS ( MODIFICATIONS ) - PAGE 15. EACH MULTIFAMILY LOAN WILL BE SUBJECT TO SPECIAL SERVICING PROVISIONS. Each Specially Serviced Multifamily Loan will be serviced in accordance with the special servicing provisions of the Servicing Agreement and the related subservicing agreement. THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDE MODIFYING ( MODIFYING ) THE TERMS OF THE LOAN IF NEEDED, selling the related mortgaged property. IF A METERIAL DEFAULT OCCURS or a payment default is reasonably foreseeable with respect to a multifamily loan, the MASTER SERVICER OR THE SPECIAL SERVICER WILL BE PERMITTED, TO MODIFY ( MODIFY ), WAIVE ( WAVE ) OR AMEND ( AMEND ) ANY TERMS ( ANY TERMS ) OF SUCH MORTGAGE LOAN, provided that SUCH MODIFICATIONS ( MODIFICATIONS ), waiver or amendment ( 1 ) is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery with respect to such mortgage loan. WELLS FARGO HAS BEEN DECIETFUL IN THEIR ANSWER as INVESTOR ALLOWS MODIFICATIONS!!

Clearly the Wells Fargos Investors PSA lets the Servicer provide Modifications. Again, I ask Wells Fargo Why was I denied my Mortgage Modification Pursuant to CPLR 3408 when on two modification submittals I showed my income at 30 % and around 24 %. Wells Fargo Incorrectly denied me a modification AND Wells Fargo failed to Deal in GOOD FAITH per CPLR 3408.

Wells Fargo was in Violation of HAMP Guidelines by denying me a copy of Investors PSA. Defined under the HAMP Guidelines When a servicer believes a PSA prevents an NPV-positive modification, the servicer shall contact the trustee and any other parties authorized under the terms of the PSA to grant a waiver, whether individual investors, credit rating agencies, bond insurers, or otherwise, in order to obtain permission to perform a HAMP modification. THE SERVICER SHALL PROVIDE ( THE SERVICERS SHALL PROVIDE ) THE BORROWER OR THE BORROWERS REPRESENATIVE A COPY ( A COPY ) OF THE LIMITING LANGUAGE IN THE POOLING SERVICE AGREEMENT ( PSA ) ( IN THE POOLING SERVICE AGREEMENT ), A COPY OF ALL CORRESPONDENCE ( A COPY OF ALL COROSPONDENCE ) WITH THE LENDER AND INVESTORS ATTEMEPTING TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY TO PREFORM A MODIFICATION, AND ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO A COMPLETE AND UNALTERED COPY OF THE PSA.

Asking Wells Fargo for a Copy of the Mandatory Waiver they had to ask the Investor for. Failure to ask for a Waiver is a Violation of HAMP.

If Investor does not participate in the program Wells Fargo should had know that withing 90 Days of executing the SPA. Wells Fargo Became the Servicer of the Investor in XX/XX/XXXX so they should had been aware of the restrictions as of XX/XX/XXXX. But for some reason Wells Fargo had me apply for a Modification 3 times in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, why if the Investor does not participate? Why a 3rd time after they said investor does not participate? All 3 times Wells Fargo Stated my income is not sufficient and over 42 % where Wells Fargos own NPV document shows Im 30 % or under and within the HAMP Guidelines.

HAMP Guidelines - 1.3 Investor Solicitation - Within 90 days of executing a SPA, the servicer MUST review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP. Within 30 days of identifying an investor as a nonparticipant, or as unwilling to extend its participation in MHA to include any extension or expansion of an MHA program, or identifying a servicing agreement that limits or prohibits a servicer from offering any assistance available under MHA, including HAMP Tier 2 modifications ( i.e., prohibition against modification of non-owner occupied mortgages or limits on multiple modification of the same mortgage ), THE SERVICER MUST CONTACT THE INVESTOR IN WRITING AT LEAST ONCE, ENCOURAGING THE INVESTOR TO PERMIT MODIFICATIONS and other assistance available under the extended and expanded MHA programs.

The Servicers should know at the time of the identification of potential candidates for the HAMP programs the eligibility qualification of the candidates based upon the servicing agreement between the Servicer and the Investor, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ). This is also a mandate of the Making Homes Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages.

WELLS FARGO under HAMP had an obligation by XX/XX/XXXX to determine investor participation in HAMP and to request a WAIVER. As Per the COURT OF APPEALS ; IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON LISSON vs WELLS FARGO BANK , N.A . ; XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. as Trustee for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Loan Trust Mod from XXXX XXXX. See, Making Home Affordable Program, Handbook for Servicers of Non-GSE Mortgages, version 4.0, ch 2, 6.5 at 99 ( XX/XX/XXXX ). FAILING TO PROVIDE A WAIVER OF THE INVESTOR RESTRICTIONS DEMOSTRATES A FAILURE TO FOLLOW HAMP GUIDELINES WHICH CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO NEGOIATE IN GOOD FAITH PRUSUANT TO CPLR 3408 ( f ).

Wells Fargo Failed to follow State and Federal Rules. HAMP Section 1.6 Compliance with Applicable Laws Each servicer and any sub-servicer that the servicer uses will be subject to and must fully comply with all federal, state, and local laws, including statutes, regulations, ordinances, administrative rules and orders that have the effect of law, and judicial rulings.

HAMP Section 2.2 Documentation - Servicers are required to maintain appropriate documentary evidence of their MHA-related activities. Required general documentation applicable to all MHA Programs includes but is not limited to : ( 1 ) Evidence of assessment of investor willingness to participate in MHA programs and any specific outreach to investors or attempts to obtain waivers on either a portfolio or loan by loan basis, including copies of any contracts with investors relied upon in denying modifications. This should include, where applicable, documentation relating to specific parameters or limitations on participation required by investors for steps in the waterfall. ( 2 ) All documents and information related to the servicers consideration of the borrower for other loss mitigation alternatives.

HAMP Section 6.5 Prohibitions on Modification Waterfall Steps- If the SERVICER IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS THAT MAKE IT UNFEASIBLE TO COMPLETE THE MODIFICATION waterfall steps, the SERVICER SHOULD IDENTIFY THIS PRIOR ( PRIOR ) TO PREFORMING THE NPV EVALUATION and NOT PREFORM AN NPV EVALUATION. Servicers must maintain evidence in the loan file documenting the nature of any deviation from taking any sequential modification step in the modification waterfall and the fact that the applicable servicing agreement, investor guideline or law restricted or prohibited fully performing the modification waterfall step. The documentation must show that the servicer made a reasonable effort to seek a waiver from the investor and whether that waiver was approved or denied.

In Violation of Section 6.5 Prohibitions on Modification, Wells Fargo did provide to me a NPV when its Investor had restrictions. I have asked Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX for a copy of the waiver Wells Fargo asked the Investor for but Wells Fargo has failed to provide one.

HAMP Section 7 Net Present Value ( NPV ) Testing - All loans that meet the applicable HAMP eligibility criteria in Section 1 must be evaluated using a standardized NPV test that compares the NPV result for a modification to the NPV result for no modification.

FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE RULE 801 ( C ) HEARSAY - Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

Rule 802 - Bars the admission of hearsay evidence unless an exception applies.

A statement contained in a document that purports to establish or affect an interest in property if the matter stated was relevant to the documents purpose unless later dealings with the property are inconsistent with the truth of the statement or the purport of the document.

IN SUMATION WELLS FARGO ( 1 ) WELLS FARGO Falsely Denying Me a Modification stating investor does not Participate in program. In this Complaint I Provided the Investors PSA prospective PROVING the INVESTOR DOES ALLOW MODIFICAATIONS!!

( 2 ) WELLS FARGO Failed to provided me the Investors PSA per HAMP, I requested numerous times in my CFPB Complaints ( QWR ). Wells Fargo denied it saying it is confidential, privileged and/or proprietary information of Wells Fargo . By myself searching for the Public Document filed at the SEC, it shows why WELLS FARGO DENIED MY REQUEST. Wells Fargo denied my request against the Servicing Agreement Wells Fargo had with the Investor. INVESTORS PROSPECTIVE PSA STATES the MASTER SERVICER OR THE SPECIAL SERVICER WILL BE PERMITTED, TO MODIFY WAIVE OR AMEND ( AMEND ) ANY TERMS ( ANY TERMS ) OF SUCH MORTGAGE LOAN, provided that SUCH MODIFICATIONS, waiver or amendment ( 1 ) is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery with respect to such mortgage loan. WELLS FARGO HAS BEEN DECIETFUL IN THEIR ANSWER as INVESTOR ALLOWS MODIFICATIONS!!

( 3 ) In 1st Modification Application as per NPV Document my monthly income was at 30 % but Wells Fargo incorrectly denied me stating it was at 42 %. Wells Fargo In Violation of CPLR 3408, HAMP Guidelines, CPLR 3408 ( e ), CFR 1024.41 ( d ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 4 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of HAMP Section 7.0 Net Present Value ( NPV ) - ( 1 ) Using the standard modification waterfall, THE RESULTS IS DEEMED POSITIVE AND THE SERVICER MUST ( MUST ) OFFER A MODIFICATION. In Wells Fargos own NPV Document shows Im at 30 % and within HAMP Guidelines making my XX/XX/XXXX Modification Application POSITIVE. 
( XXXX ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of HAMP 6.5 With knowing the Investors Restrictions, Wells Fargo should not had run an NPV Evaluation.

( 6 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of the Appellate Court Rulings If the servicer is subject to restrictions that make it unfeasible to complete the modification waterfall steps, the servicer should identify this PRIOR TO PERFORMING THE NPV EVAUATION and NOT PERFORM an NPV evaluation.

( 7 ) In 2ND Modification Application was now denied on investor does not participate in program. Wells Fargo in Violation of CPLR 3408 did not Negotiate in Good Faith. Wells Fargo should had known the Investors restrictions before ever having me start a Useless Modification Applications lasting over 1 year.

( 8 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of the FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE RULE 801 ( C ) HEARSAY, RULE 802, RULE 803 ( 7 ) ( 15 ). Making a broad Statement investor does not participate in program when Wells Fargo has the documents to back it up but fails to provide them, the statement falls under Hearsay.

( 9 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section - 1.3 Investor Solicitation Wells Fargo had the Duty to review all servicing agreements to determine investor participation in HAMP. Since Wells Fargo is claiming after my 2nd modification application the investor does not participate in program they are in Violation of HAMP 1.3.

( 10 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of HAMP Section - 1.3 Investor Solicitation - WELLS FARGO FAILED to contact the investor in writing asking for a Waiver.

( 11 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of APPELLATE RULING APPELLATE DIVISION, SECOND DEPARTMENT, NEW YORK. CITIMORTGAGE INC v. LOFRIA failed to demonstrate that it followed HAMP regulations and guidelines, i.e., that it MADE ANY EFFORT AT ALL TO SEEK A WAIVER ( 12 ) WELLS FARGO In Violation of APPEALS Court Ruling in THE COURT OF APPEALS LISSON vs WELLS FARGO BANK N.A. ; XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX. as Trustee for XXXX XXXX FAILING TO PROVIDE A WAIVER OF THE INVESTOR RESTRICTIONS DEMOSTRATES A FAILURE TO FOLLOW HAMP GUIDELINES WHICH CONSTITUTE A FAILURE TO NEGOIATE IN GOOD FAITH PRUSUANT TO CPLR 3408 ( f ). ( 13 ) WELLS FARGO in Violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ) IF A LENDER HAS DENIED THE APPLICATION, THE FOLLOWING IS REQUIRED ( REQUIRED ) : 1 ). DENIAL LETTER GIVING THE DATA INPUT FIELDS AND VALUES USED IN THE EVALUATION. I Requested from Wells Fargo multiple times for a copy of the Investors PSA for my review to see the servicing Rules, Restrictions or Prohibitions. Wells Fargo Response 5/3/23 Weve completed our review of your request for pooling and servicing agreements and a copy of the investor restrictions used in the modification review. Due to the items being confidential, privileged and/or proprietary information, were unable to provide the information requested. Per CPLR 3408 ( e ) if borrower is denied based on investors restrictions they are required to provide EVIDENCE of the PSA. Wells Fargo in Violation of CPLR 3408 ( e ) IF A LENDER HAS DENIED THE APPLICATION, THE FOLLOWING IS REQUIRED ( REQUIRED ) : 2 ). IF DENIAL WAS BASED ON INVESTOR RESTRICTIONS, EVIDENCE SUCH AS A POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT. This is another Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) pursuant to the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act ( section 2605 ( e ) ). 1 ) Specifically requesting from Wells Fargo, a copy of the Investors PSA showing the Guidelines, Rules and Restrictions the Mortgage Servicer must follow. 2 ) Again, Im asking Wells Fargo for the documents that show how they came up with your modified payment amount would be more than 42 % of your monthly income. I have the Wells Fargo NPV proving using Wells Fargos numbers that I qualify at 30 % of HAMP. 3 ) Im asking Wells Fargo for the documents that show the written request ( per Section 1.3 ) of the investor for a Waiver of the restrictions. 4 ) Specifically requesting from Wells Fargo, per HAMP Guidelines Section 6.5 Im requesting a copy of the request that Wells Fargo MUST SEND TO INVESTOR SEEKING A WAIVER REQUEST and whether or not that Waiver was approved or not."
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"l noticed that my account always was minus at the end of the month. i thought that maybe i had subscribed to something and did not know. when i investigated, i found out the bank was robbing me blind. they were saying my money was there.when i pulled it out they made it an illegal pullout. then made it a minus and charged me an overdraft fee on top of it..so when my money did come in i was already minus on the money i pulled out. even if there is some legalese that protects them it is immoral fora bank that you felt was protecting you to be robbing you blind.wells fargo bank XXXX XXXX."
5/10/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Loan balance remaining after the vehicle is repossessed and sold,"I was stranded in XXXX during the beginning of the XXXX pandemic. I had my vehicle parked in the economy lot of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I was finally able to return to pick up my vehicle, I was unable to pay the parking fees as they were exorbitant. 

I attempted to work with both the parking authority and the bank that I received the loan from, but neither would offer any assistance and were entirely inconsiderate of the unprecedented situation that occurred due to the XXXX pandemic. 

Eventually, even though I was maintaining payments on my loan and making all possible attempts to retrieve the vehicle, the bank decided to repossess the vehicle, and I was forced to default on the loan. 

After the vehicle was repossessed, it was then sold through an auction, and the proceeds from the sale were applied to the remaining balance of the loan. However, they then added the cost of the parking lot fees to the balance of the loan, and have reported it to credit bureaus as a delinquent account. 

In summary, due to unprecedented circumstances surrounding this situation as a result of the XXXX pandemic I was forced to relinquish possession of my vehicle in a manner which seemed unjust. Furthermore, after having the vehicle repossessed without any recourse, I have had my credit score damaged due to what was, again, an unprecedented situation that affected billions of people worldwide."
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Over the course of XXXX and XXXX, Wells Fargo repeatedly charged overdraft fees, which led me to close the account."
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,I went inside bank and they assured me they would fix account never did I just closed my account and stop banking with them
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Cashing a check,"Before I was married my name was XXXX XXXX and I went to cash a check at a Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX NJ. I was asked if I wanted to open up an account and I told the teller no but he sent me to a personal banker who said that he needed my social security number to cash my check because I was not a customer. Later on I began receiving letters saying that I had overdraft fees in my account but I was confused because I never opened an account or was issued a debit card. When I brought the overdraft letters to a bank in XXXX, NJ the bank manager said not to worry about the letter and discard it. It turns out the personal banker opened an account for me without my permission to meet their quota when he asked for my social security number while cashing my paycheck."
5/10/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,After working with Wells Fargo for over 2 months on this issue I have just been told that the resolution for the issue is for me to contact the condo association and request a refund to Wells Fargo from my XXXX account on their behalf even though they made the payment in error based on incorrect information given to them by the condo association. At the time that wells fargo made the payment in error the account had been paid in full and kept cuare n't to this point today. I provided Wells Fargo the documestation verifying the payment and the day It was made which was Approximately two months prior to their payment that they made based on Inaccurate information received from the condio association. I feel that the given resolution by Wells Fargo is completely unsatisfactory. I feel that the responsability to ask for a Refund from the condo association should be done by Wells Fargo since they made the payment in error based on incorrect information from the condo assocpatient. I feel that I am not responsible for their mistake. Therefore I should not be responsible for requesting the refund wells fargo from the condo association. In addition to this complaint I would like to request any information I can get on on any regulatory agency that can assist further with this issue. These CFP B complaints have not been effective in getting Wells fargo to fix the mistakes they have made so I would like to escalate the issue to a higher authority Than the c f p b to get a satisfactory resolution of this issue.
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,I had an Account where I was charged for many overdraft fees and tried to resolve them thru the company but I had an account for years
5/10/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,My XXXX XXXX card was automatically transferred to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2023. I activated it that day. I went on line to set up the account for payment on line that same day and I was unable to do so. I called their XXXX number for assistance and was told they needed more information and I needed to go a branch to try and set up the account on line. I then called their customer service number who then transferred me XXXX and spoke with XXXX who told me I needed to have a mobile phone in order to open the account on line. I told her I did not have a mobile phone and that the site stated in the on line application that the mobile phone was only recommended. She told me that it was required. I said I thought that would be discriminatory against elderly and poor people. She forwarded me to their XXXX XXXX and I spoke with XXXX and I told him to just cancel the card. He recommended that I wait until my payment by phone was processed. The next day I received a message from XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX offices. I left 3 messages for her and did not receive a call back. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX that my phone payment had been credited to the account. I then called and closed my account. Told them the reason for closing the account was that the requirement to have a mobile phone in order to open the on line account was discriminatory and that no other financial institution that I deal with requires that. No one talked to has been able to explain their policy. I still believe that the requirement to have a mobile phone is discriminatory.
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,CD (Certificate of Deposit),Managing an account,Problem with fees or penalties,"I applied online for a 5-month CD on the Wells Fargo website on XX/XX/2023. The stated offer was that an APY of 4.1 % was being offered to non-existing customers, but that people with an existing relationship with Wells Fargo would be offered the higher APY of 4.25 %. I presumed that since I've had my primary checking account with Wells Fargo for the past 8 years and been in good standing, that this constituted an existing relationship with the bank, so I had expected a 4.25 % APY. This was a lower interest rate than was available at other banks ( per  XXXX XXXX, but I thought 4.25 % was reasonable given the convenience of having the account in the same bank as my checking account. When I tried to apply, the website does not post the actual interest rate they are providing on the website, but rather provides links to load additional webpages that would display that information before signing. I tried several times to access those documents, and they would not load correctly on the website- they could not be viewed. The only way to proceed with opening the account was to click accept, so I did, all the while assuming I was getting the 4.25 % APY rate. Several days later, I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo, which confirmed that I had gotten the 4.1 % interest rate instead of the expected 4.25 % interest rate. I called the customer support phone number provided the next day ( XX/XX/2023 ) and they explained that the reason the "" relationship rate '' was not provided was that my checking account was classified as "" preferred '' and not "" prime, '' and that only the latter account was eligible. The only requirement for avoiding a monthly service fee in a prime account is maintaining a combined balance of at least $ XXXX, but since I was opening a CD with $ XXXX, this combined balance would by definition be met ( in addition to the XXXX $ XXXX remaining in my checking account ). I asked why my account was not just made prime so that I could receive the relationship rate and he mentioned that they could in fact do that, but that it could not be done and would need to be done in person at a Wells Fargo branch. He assured me that all I would need to do is switch my checking account overt to a prime account and that they would close the CD for me and re-open it at the new interest rate without any penalty. He also scheduled the appointment with me at my local Wells Fargo branch today ( XX/XX/2023 ). I arrived at the appointment at the Wells Fargo Branch ( at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ) on time, and after waiting for 5 minutes, was seen by XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX took down all my information and helped convert my checking account to a Prime account. During this process, I was sent via email a link to view documents to review about the fee structure of the checking account. I clicked the link to the documents with my smartphone and just as occurred when I tried to open the CD account online, the documents would not load. I showed XXXX XXXX my phone and the swirling circle demonstrating that the documents were not loading and could not be viewed. She advised that I could just view the documents later on my laptop and sign to accept the new account, which I did. In retrospect, this was an acknowledgement by a Wells Fargo employee that the electronic documents that are required to be viewed by law before signing were not available to be signed and that most reasonable people will move forward and sign and review the documents after the fact ( as I did when trying to open the CD in the first place ). XXXX XXXX then called the CD division to see about opening a new CD at the relationship rate without a penalty. She was told that I would be charged a penalty of over {$400.00} if I closed the CD and reopened a new one, contradicting what I was told on the phone several days earlier. I told XXXX XXXX that I thought I was being mistreated and asked to speak to someone on their escalations team as I wanted to file a complaint. The escalation team said that no one was available to speak with me, but they took down my details ( making me wait 75 minutes while XXXX XXXX entered all the information ) and have someone reach out to me by email in 48 business hours. I will update CFPB if Wells Fargo does respond appropriately and waive the penalty as promised by phone last week, but even the process I was made to go through thus far, wasting 1.5 hours of my time out of a busy work week is unfair, particularly since the dispute stems from an acknowledged problem with their website ( which may well be an intentional effort to mislead customers and cheat them out of money ). As this is likely to trap other potential customers in the future, I thought it was important to bring this to the attention of the CFPB. Your efforts may not help me, but they may help other potential customers in the future. Thank you for looking into this."
5/10/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"Our mortgage company, Wells Fargo, has breached our Mortgage contract, and the attached PUD Rider. Our mortgage allows for HOA or "" association dues, '' that do not replace the mortgage security interest, which they do not as Oklahoma is not an HOA Super Lien state. The HOA dues are supposed to be escrowed. This is also allowed for in the PUD Rider. We were sued last year by our HOA in Small Claims Court for HOA Dues that were not dated, and given a default judgment. I filed a Motion to Dismiss, the XXXX XXXX XXXX would not allow it stating that we did not pay a {$76.00} fee that is not listed anywhere. A collection agent is not supposed to be able to use small claims court under 12 O.S. 1751 ( B ), and that is what this attorney is. I was not able to go to court due to a XXXX, but the judge still gave a default judgment, with 850 % or {$2200.00} in attorney fees. My wife went to the hearing yesterday because it was a hearing on assets, but the collections attorney went ahead and put a stay on it. The court put down that the defendant failed to appear. So I'm not sure what is going on with the court. So the court and HOA 's attorney both have violated Regulation F. Wells Fargo has breached our mortgage contract, which is the point of this complaint. They have breached their duty of good faith by causing my wife and me undue stress with this lawsuit. We have written them, and they have sent us back 2 or 3 letters. I know the Plaintiff 's attorney wrote them because Wells Fargo sent us a letter telling us that they received a letter from him. We never heard what happened. I called Wells Fargo multiple times, and one time I was told, "" sir, this is not our problem, you need to pay this. '' It is their problem. We don't owe these HOA dues, and they need to get this young man off of our backs. The small town Court could care less what we have to say. I'm copying our title company. I'm making a claim for title insurance. I found that the day our title insurance was taken out, the builder 's mortgage had not been paid off until the next day, XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo did not make their title change until XX/XX/XXXX. The Homeowner 's Association made a huge change to the covenants in XX/XX/XXXX and completely changed them. Our household was not notified, and several others that I have talked to were not notified. The new document is very discriminatory, takes away all voting rights, and makes it to that 2-3 board members can do whatever they want in the name of common areas that are not even close to my house. They are also fining people for things done on city streets and their own properties. This puts an undue burden on the title. I'm putting a claim on the title insurance for the full amount. I also am claiming a breach with Wells Fargo."
5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Managing an account,Banking errors,Wells Fargo did not allow me online access for 5 months. A SSI direct deposit was very short because I had no access to account while traveling although went in the branch 5 times.

There was no communication about returned payments and no warning about closing account, so I could redeem the points.

All I got from Wells Fargo was a letter saying my account is closed.

The securities filing says that Wells Fargo discovered a calculation error in its automated software for calculating whether a borrower should be offered more favorable loan terms in lieu of foreclosure.

In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo revised its estimate, announcing that the miscalculation actually affected XXXX homes that were going through foreclosure between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. This was a system error on there part. 

I was improperly denied mortgage modification and they would not accept my payments via phone for some reason. It would literally always be a hassle whenever I physically stepped into a wells fargo branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was wrongfully foreclosed on due to Wells Fargo not being able to implement and maintain the proper software and protocols to correctly determine whether a mortgage modification was required under federal regulations.

5/10/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"This marks my second formal complaint directed towards Wells Fargo. I find it unnecessary to restate my concerns as their previous response demonstrated a lack of attention toward the content of my communication. It is evident that I am justified in this matter, while the sellers involved exhibit unethical business practices. 

I would like to address the issue at hand involving Wells Fargo Bank and XXXX. The situation unfolded when I purchased two identical cameras, namely the "" XXXX XXXX, '' from XXXX for my XXXX XXXX XXXX. After realizing that I only needed one camera, I decided to return the other. The seller for one camera was Beach Camera Same Day Shipping, an independent seller on the XXXX XXXX, while the other camera was sold directly by XXXX. 

Unfortunately, during the return process, I mistakenly shipped the wrong camera to XXXX XXXX. As both cameras were identical models ( both being XXXX XXXX ), with the only difference being the serial numbers. It was an honest mistake. 

Weeks passed without any progress on the refund, and I contacted XXXX XXXX to inquire about the status. They informed me that I had returned a camera with a different serial number, and they were unable to issue a refund. I apologized for the mistake and offered to send them the correct camera while requesting the return of the one I had shipped by error. They agreed to the arrangement, and I paid for shipping to send the correct camera back to them. 

I diligently tracked the shipment and confirmed its delivery to XXXX XXXX 's warehouse. However, when I inquired about the refund and the return of the camera I had sent, they claimed they never received it. They assured me that they would investigate the matter, but months went by without any resolution. They even refused to return the camera I had mistakenly sent, despite providing the serial number as evidence that they possessed it. Furthermore, they denied receiving the correctly returned camera, even though the tracking information clearly indicated delivery and confirmation by their warehouse During this time, it appeared that XXXX XXXX profited from this situation, as they retained both my money ( approximately {$1300.00} ) and an additional camera, all while evading any consequences. I was unable to file an A-Z claim or report the seller to XXXX due to the closure of my XXXX account around the same time, citing "" too many returns. '' This account had been active since 2014, with numerous purchases made over the years. While returns were inevitable, they were always conducted promptly and in compliance with XXXX 's policies. I feel disappointed and let down by XXXX 's treatment in this matter. 

Facing a lack of recourse, I reached my breaking point and resorted to threatening the seller with legal action and complaints to relevant consumer protection agencies. Eventually, they relented and returned the camera they had been holding hostage. However, they failed to provide a refund for the original camera I had returned, resulting in their profit without any loss of inventory. 

Realizing that resolving the matter with the seller would likely entail more lengthy exchanges, I decided to initiate a chargeback through my bank, Wells Fargo. I explicitly explained to the Wells Fargo representative that the reason for the dispute was the failure to receive a refund despite returning an item and providing tracking information. Though, to my surprise I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that they had reversed the claim, alleging that the charges were authorized by me or someone with my permission. This decision was inexplicable since I never claimed unauthorized charges or reported a stolen card. My intention was solely to dispute the non-refunded purchase. 

When I contacted Wells Fargo 's claims department to seek assistance, I faced lengthy wait times on hold. Eventually, when I spoke to a representative, I was informed that they could no longer assist me as the case had been finalized. The representative also mentioned that the documentation provided by the XXXX seller supported their version of events, including a dispute claiming that I had returned a completely different camera. It was infuriating to discover that the seller had lied in the documentation to shift blame onto me, especially considering they were able to provide documentation while I was unable to do so. Despite expressing my frustration repeatedly, the representative offered only apologies and stated that the case had been closed, suggesting that I reach out to XXXX for further assistance. Frustrated and recognizing the futility of pursuing help from both Wells Fargo and XXXX, I ended the call. 

In hindsight, I regret attempting to resolve the matter directly with the seller and now realize that reselling the camera would have been a simpler solution to recoup my losses. However, with neither XXXX nor my bank willing to assist me, I find myself in a precarious financial situation, being approximately {$1300.00} in debt without any recourse. 

I would like to emphasize once again that my mistake involved shipping a camera with a different serial number, while both cameras were identical models. Despite this error, I promptly acknowledged and rectified the situation by arranging to return the correct camera and requesting the return of the mistakenly shipped one. Our agreement also included a refund for shipping costs, for which I agreed to cover the shipping expenses. 

Unfortunately, due to the passage of time since XXXX of last year, the tracking number is no longer accessible as XXXX discards tracking numbers older than 120 days. However, I possess proof of receipt from XXXX  and am confident that if the involved companies take my claims seriously, they can contact XXXX and utilize their internal systems to verify the tracking number 's authenticity. 

Regarding documentation, I regret that some evidence is no longer accessible due to the closure of my XXXX account. However, I still have relevant correspondence saved in my email. While the provided evidence may lack some context and is not presented in chronological order, I will offer explanations to supplement it. 

1 : This screenshot represents my initial contact with Amazon regarding the situation. The displayed tracking information pertains to the correctly returned camera. During this conversation, the representative suggested filing an A-Z claim, but I declined, believing the seller would resolve the matter without resorting to such measures. After this chat, I contacted XXXX again to cancel the claim. 

2 : Please refer to point 1 for context.

3 : Please refer to point 1 for context.

4-4c : These screenshots serve as evidence that the images correspond to the correctly returned camera. 

5 : This document demonstrates that the issue has persisted since XXXX. 

6 : This is my initial communication with XXXX after they closed my account. The closure was prompted by my statement to a chat representative regarding the absence of a refund despite the tracking information indicating delivery. This conversation relates to the camera I mistakenly returned, before discovering it was the same model with a different serial number. 

6a-6b : These email replies were sent to XXXX, accompanied by tracking information. The recipient address on these emails indicates that they pertain to the wrong camera shipped, as it shows a "" return dock '' rather than the provided address by the seller. 

7 : This document confirms the agreement made with the seller, wherein I agreed to return the correct camera while expecting the return of the mistakenly shipped one. It also includes the condition that a refund would be issued if I covered the shipping costs. 

8 : This communication from the seller informs me that the camera I had returned was incorrect, thus justifying the lack of a refund. It also demonstrates their possession of the wrong camera for several months. 

9 : This document showcases the seller 's feigned cluelessness and their continued possession of both cameras until XXXX. 

10 : These screenshots highlight the seller 's lack of response for a period of 10 days, despite their promise to assist me. It also reveals my support for them, only to be treated in such a manner. 

11 : The subsequent communication with the seller consists of generic responses and further wasting of time. 

12 : The seller responds 14 days later, claiming they can not locate the package and attempting to shift blame onto me by mentioning the weight discrepancy, which resulted from my failure to return certain attachments that were included. 

12a : My response addresses their claims and provides clarification. 

13 : The seller declares their inability to assist me at all.

14 : XXXX XXXX not only refuses to refund the money they kept but also retains their original camera while holding the camera I sent them hostage. 

14a : Frustrated with their actions, I express my exasperation.

15 : The seller 's response to my previous communication.

15a : This crucial piece of evidence displays the exact information provided by the tracking number before it was discarded for exceeding t

he 120-day limit. It also reiterates our agreement. 16 : Finally, the seller releases the camera they had been holding hostage. However, they never responded to my message. Consequently, I promptly initiated a chargeback with my bank for the correct camera that I returned but never received a refund for. 

I hope this additional information provides a comprehensive overview of the situation, highlighting the sequence of events and the challenges I encountered while seeking resolution. 

I sincerely hope that my case is taken seriously and that the full extent of the hardships I have endured, from dealing with an uncooperative seller to contacting Wells Fargo, filing my initial CFPB complaint, facing denial, and now rewriting this complaint, is duly acknowledged. It is disheartening to find myself still burdened with a debt of {$1300.00} despite my efforts to rectify the situation. I trust that a fair and thorough investigation will be conducted to provide a resolution and alleviate the financial strain I have experienced."

I said wait a minute when were you going to advise me of this And I was informed that they didnt have to so they had been charging me overdraft fees and I had a large amount of money sitting in a savings account and they were just charging me overdraft fees, eating up my money because they only allow me to do it three times but no one ever informed me of that."

The reason they gave me is that I was using my personal accounts for business money services. So they closed all my accounts without notice and put all the remaining balance on hold.

Everytime I go to a branch, banker oriented me to loss and prevention. Very frustrating situation. 
I contacted a lawyer about the situation, he advised me to file a claim with CFPB first to see if the bank can resolve this situation without further legal escalation.

I checked to verify the number on XXXX and Wells Fargo security resource associated with the number popped up so I believed it was informing me of my account.

He then proceeded to ask me did I give permission to wire money to the individual and I stated NO then he asked have I been using my card at any outside gas stations and I stated yes since a couple of days prior I did use my card at an outside gas station and is aware that some people do leave trackers to steal peoples card information and recommend that I use my card inside of stores for future references so I honestly thought maybe someone could be using my card information. I then checked my account and noticed that everything was still intact and told him that and he then told me that he could still see the the processing of the wire transfer occurring and wanted to help me stop it from going through. He even stated that whoever was trying to use my account/ scam me turned off my notifications so I wouldnt be able to be notified of what was going on and stated that he can assist me with getting my account changed into a new one so the transfer can be stopped. He then sent me a link to my phone to verify my information and started sending other links and codes to my phone number, I would read out the code to him and he would tell me that hes taking a look at my account and trying to stop the process of the transfer. A few moments go by from being on hold and he tells me that hes almost done working on my account and trying to get everything situated as well as trying to turn back on my notifications that were supposedly turned off. He was even able to somehow send me the notifications to my email from Wells Fargo of the guy XXXX trying to wire transfer my money to himself and then tells me hes going to transfer me to his supervisor so he could look over some things before finishing up with everything. A few more minutes go by and I was greeted by another man who stated he was his supervisor whose name I genuinely dont remember and was told by him that everything had been updated with my account and everything was taken cared of as far as stopping the transfer from occurring and was recommended that I not log back into my online banking due to the new changes and that I would receive a phone call the next day @ XXXX to be assisted with signing back into my online banking. The next day XXXX came and past and I called the XXXX number and was greeted by the Wells Fargo operator and explained everything that occurred the previous day and was told that they couldnt find any documentation of any fraudulent activity going on and was then transferred to the fraud department and then explained everything to them once again and was then told that thats sounds like what I occurred was a scam and that my account looked okay and when I went to log into my online banking I noticed that the money in my savings were gone and that the money was indeed wire transferred, I was able to file a claim and now Im just hoping everything can be completed and the money can be given back. This has caused a lot of emotional distress this past week."
5/12/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"I am asking explicit questions and demanding clear and concise answers 1. Why werent Federal Regulations obeyed prior to foreclosing? According to Document 24 CFR 203.604 which states on the Note that I signed with XXXX XXXX XXXX  Company dated XX/XX/XXXX reads as follows : This Note does not authorize acceleration when not permitted by HUD regulations. As used in the Note, Secretary means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or his or her designee. 

Wells Fargo responded that it does not need authorization from HUD to accelerate foreclosure. Problem! Prove it! 

2. What does that mean to the borrower who signed a contractual agreement apparently under false pretense? Thats a serious disclosure problem! 

Are Federal Laws written and legislated for decoration only giving the servicer the right to take advantage of the borrower? Thats a question and I want an answer. 

3. Why servicer did not prove standing proving that the Note was owned by the bank? Thats a question and I want an answer. 

4. Did XXXX XXXX XXXX work as an employee for Wells Fargo throughout the foreclosure process of my mortgage? Thats a question and I want an answer. 
In the Certification of Diligent Inquiry XXXX XXXX XXXX certifies that Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . directly or through an agent has possession of the promissory note. 
Proof was requested of the employee and title of XXXX XXXX XXXX as it relates to Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . 
This individual can not be found on the Lexis Diligence site. 
Robo Signing is illegal!!!!!! 

XXXX. Requesting proof of the travel of the promissory note citing Bank of New York Mellon v Davis Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division, XX/XX/XXXX Docket No. A-1006-16T1, unpublished. 

6. Requesting information on why there are two endorsements of the Note to Wells Fargo? 

The Assignment of the Note to Wells Fargo clearly states that Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems , Inc. ( MERS ) is the nominee. The role of Nominee is in a limited capacity. However, MERS can not act in any capacity in the State of New Jersey except as a recording agency. This fact is confirmed by XXXX XXXX, Licensing Supervisor in the Department of Banking and Insurance ( DOBI ) in response to third party OPRA request. Pursuant to their own guideline, MERS does not fund loans, therefore they do not have the legal right to assign or transfer anything, nor can they discharge or foreclose ; In this regard, MERS must prove consideration for this Assignment to be valid. As this Assignment is a recorded document, Inst # XXXX N.J.S.A. 2C : 28-7a Tampering with Public Records applies , New Jersey Supreme Court Cases addressing this Statue are In Re Gross, 178 N.J. 377 D-20 XX/XX/XXXX and In Re Stier ; 108 N.J. 455D-104 XX/XX/XXXX The assignment indicates an address for XXXX XXXX Mortgage Company at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Michigan XXXX. However, this is the address of MERS. XXXX XXXX Mortgage Company did not have an office in Michigan.

I received XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX of Secured Property. Fair market value of property was {$140000.00}. Balance of principal outstanding shown as {$130000.00}. Where is {$9300.00}?????? 

XXXX. Why would Wells Fargo seemingly bribe the justice system, a judge in particular to rule in its favor on fraudulent foreclosures, knowing its business principles are as crooked as XXXX XXXX XXXX? 


XXXX. The enticement of partnering with the justice system was captured by inviting a judge ( XXXX ) to rule favorably for Wells Fargo in fraudulent foreclosures and sealed in a relationship through unearned XXXX XXXX XXXX Account. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, New Jersey.

As a customer, I feel deceived and taken advantage of by these excessive charges. I believe that Wells Fargo 's actions are in violation of fair lending practices and have caused me undue financial hardship.

I have repeatedly told him that I did not receive the sales paperwork until two weeks after the deal was done.

Sat this branches ATM, I first used my XXXX debit card to withdraw {$1000.00} from XXXX and was charged a {$3.00} service charge. I received {$1000.00} in {$20.00} dollar bills and proceeded to deposit {$960.00} into my Wells Fargo checking.

A few days later, I received a letter from Wells Fargo advising me that they will reverse the charge claiming that it was authorized by me.

I don't understand how is possible... did they reach out to Merchant in XXXX? They mailed us the investigation results and showed some IT transactions and we called back and asked for an explanation they could not provide. Never had any credit issues and I don't understand they can think that they can charge us for something we never approve or requested. When they sent the case to one of their internal investigator, XXXX XXXX, she wrote back to us the following : I name XXXX XXXX as a victim. We desperately need your help as Wells Fargo refused to assist any more."

I made my payments on-time and they had my truck repossessed in XXXX, XXXX  after only missing one payment. They've since obviously sold the truck and have forgiven the remaining debt on the loan. I have a XXXX balance and my loan is literally months from falling off of my credit report, BUT, they've incorrectly labeled my payment history on my credit reports. 

I recently read an article posted on XXXX from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  titled "" Wells Fargo might owe you moneyheres how to get it. '' In that article, it said that Wells Fargo had been sued and that anyone that had an auto loan between XXXX  and XXXX  would qualify for damages. 

It specifically said "" For auto loan customers, illegal practices include prepaid gap coverage that wasnt refunded when loans were paid off early, incorrectly applied payments that led to higher interest charges and fees, and unwarranted auto repossessions. The total amount of damages owed to each affected customer will vary, according to numbers provided by the CFPB. For automobile repossessions, compensation is at least, but is not limited to, {$4000.00}. '' I believe that I'm affected and I have NOT received {$4000.00}. 

My Loan Account ended in XXXX Since the repossession of my vehicle, I've moved and changed phone numbers. Unfortunately, I only have the last four digits of my account number, however, I can provide my name, social, former address, anything they need."

When I called the fraud department, I was either ( a ) told that I had no account with them associated with the phone number I called in from, even though they were the ones that messaged me ON THAT EXACT NUMBER or ( b ) put on hold to speak to a representative and then the call would would never connect to someone in their fraud department or I would be transferred to the incorrect department. I am currently unable to reach any person at Well Fargo after they messaged me at XXXX in the morning regarding a charge I did not do as I was home. 

Well Fargo already has a trash reputation after committing criminal fraud when opening up accounts illegally for people without permission and they are now precariously close to having a formal complaint filed to MasterCard for violating the card holder agreement and not properly connecting a customer to the fraud department for unauthorized use of their card."

I was initially provided a receipt noting that the funds would be available on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a memo from Wells Fargo morning of XX/XX/XXXX stating that the funds wouldnt be available until XX/XX/XXXX due to a returned check. I called Wells Fargo they said XXXX had written a bad check to another customer, so I would need to go into a branch to get it resolved. I went to the branch, the customer service agent told me the same thing as the rep on the phone, and so did her manager. They said to come back when their branch manager was in office Tuesday because back office had placed a hold. I called XXXX to ask about the bad check ; they said they couldnt discuss anyone elses account. I asked if they had in fact written a bad check or were going bankrupt ; she said no. My bank can call to verify the funds. At this point all Wells Fargo branches were closed. On Monday, I went to the XXXX branch to talk to a branch manager, but there wasnt one in that day. The nearest manager would be balboa, but XXXX, the manager, was in a meeting but the manager may be able to help. She confirmed with XXXX that the funds hadnt been released to Wells Fargo yet, so I wouldnt be able to retrieve them even if they had been released to WF. This circle of back and forth continued between XXXX and Wells Fargo about calling to verify funds. I finally spoke to a WF rep that was willing to reach out to loss prevention for assistance. The loss prevention agent contacted XXXX XXXX, but XXXX XXXX XXXX wasnt able to verify the funds because they couldnt locate them. XXXX continues to claim that the checks had been processed and deposited. However, there still wasnt any confirmation from Wells Fargo. My employer recommended going into a XXXX branch if they could help or call them. I called, but the rep said because it was from a business they couldnt check it only if it had been a personal account. As the week progressed I spoke to roughly 60 Wells Fargo customer service agents ; all who continued to say there was nothing they could do but the process is to try again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. However, I close on my house on XX/XX/XXXX. No one seemed to truly comprehend that the purchase of my home was at stake. On Thursday morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) my employer was able to gather the check numbers, dollar amount of checks and date it posted on the issuers account for me. Information that was previously requested from the loss presentation people above, but empower provided the information until XX/XX/XXXX. My employer informed me of the information and I called XXXX Wells Fargo to see if their bank manager was in. He wouldnt be until XXXX because he was at a meeting, but to come in or call then. I called the balboa branch multiple times, and the auto machine said no one is available to assist me and automatically hung up. Another branch, said they werent going to do it, because they didnt want to take on the risk. I called the XXXX branch back at XXXX, but the manager hadnt shown up. She took my contact info, so he could call me when he got in. At XXXX, I called back because the manager had yet to contact me. The operations manager said she couldnt help me either because her risk specialist told her not too. It would be a branch manager situation. She would try to call XXXX, but it would have to wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow, Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I showed up a few minutes before the branch opened and spoke with XXXX. The manager that they had referenced the day before that hadnt shown up. He agreed to call XXXX, the contact at XXXX, to verify the funds. I was finally able to collect and wire the money prior to closing. The treatment from all institutions was inadequate, delayed, and has I not been persistent with this entire situation would likely wouldve lost my house entirely."

My now deceased grandfather cosigned on a personal loan from Wells Fargo, and financial aid assured me all would be covered. This was a lie. Fall semester XXXX ( prior to completing my program in XX/XX/XXXX ) I was now informed by the financial aid office that there would be an additional balance of {$1200.00} or so. Wells Fargo would not allow me to increase my balance, nor add on an additional loan to pay for this remaining balance. As a result, while I continued to make payments to both XXXXXXXX XXXX and to Wells Fargo ( as I was forced to begin payments immediately while I was still XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX withheld both my transcript and diploma. The school has since declared bankruptcy and permanently closed, so I am no longer to receive what I earned."
5/14/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem using a debit or ATM card,"We always check our bank accounts to check on balances and transactions. We were surprised to see a {$1000.00} ATM withdrawal from our account on XX/XX/XXXX. The withdrawal was a Non-WF ATM withdrawal somewhere in Pennsylvania. My husband and I were nowhere near Pennsylvania at that time. As a matter of fact, we were not in the United States at that time the withdrawal was made as we were both on a cruise from XXXX XXXX XXXX and we both have our ATM cards in our possession. My husband had been XXXX  since XX/XX/XXXX and only returned to the United States on XX/XX/XXXX. As a matter of fact, my husband used his ATM card in the XXXX which shows that he has his card in his possession. 

We contacted Wells Fargo Bank N.A. right away to report the fraud incident. They conducted an investigation and told us that our claim is denied as the chip was used to conduct the ATM transaction by us or someone authorized by us and it was legitimate. 

We have proof we were out of the country when the incident happened so it is impossible for us to make the withdrawal. I sent an email to their cardclaim department and attached copies of our airline itinerary and cruise documents showing that we were out of the country. They told me that a supervisor would contact us in the next 2 business days but we never got a call back. I called again and was told the same thing but never got a call back. Someone called us yesterday while we are at a graduation ceremony and left a voice mail. We tried calling that person back, but no success. 

I searched the internet and XXXX  if a card chip can be duplicated and sure enough there were articles of criminal activities of cloning ATM chips. I demanded Wells Fargo to investigate further but they refused and insisted that our case is closed. Our case is never closed for us as we are out of pocket by {$1000.00} plus the {$2.00} Non-Wells Fargo transaction fees. We are not rich people and this amount is a huge amount for us. 

Wells Fargo is supposed to protect our money. However, in this case, they did not protect us and they did not do their due diligence. They should go after that person who made the withdrawal who obviously is a criminal and conduct a more thorough investigation and return our money back to us."

5/14/23,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Managing the loan or lease,Billing problem,Was told by wells fargo to hold off on paying my car loan payment for the month as they had to verify previous payments and so I made one late payment because I was told to wait and it hurt my credit and my mothers credit.
5/14/23,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC),Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,"During the last week of XXXX, we first became aware that Wells Fargo had filed a notice of default, dated XX/XX/XXXX, with the intention to foreclose on our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The home, as previously held in the name of the Trust of XXXX XXXX XXXX was wrongly allowed to be used as collateral in a personal loan taken out by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( deceased ), mother-in-law and trustee to the now defunct trust. The property was transferred into the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX belatedly and by court order in XXXX but was, by attorney error, quit claim to XXXX with the encumbrance of the WF lien. 

Our complaint is that we have made multiple efforts to speak with Wells Fargo about this loan as we are obtaining a mortgage to remedy the debt and prevent losing our home with substantial equity however no one will speak with us about the payoff amount. XXXX XXXX has personally reached out to the WF Life Events and Home Equity Deceased ( XXXX ) Departments and both continue to say they can not discuss the loan. We believes Wells Fargo may be intentionally blocking our attempts to allow us the opportunity to payoff the loan and halt the foreclosure process. 

XXXX XXXX first received written notice of the action in a certified letter on XX/XX/XXXX. No recourse as to how he might contact WF to resolve this debt was included. On XX/XX/XXXX, we had already begun forwarding documents demonstrating his rightful ownership of the property he has occupied for 37 years. 

Our lawyer, XXXX XXXX submitted a Letter of Representation on XX/XX/XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, collector and current trustee for this issue, requesting to discuss this foreclosure action for a resolution. We have made multiple phone calls to XXXX XXXX who have continually advised us all the ownership documents are "" being reviewed at the WF legal department ''. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we first met with XXXX XXXX, Relationship Banker at Wells Fargo in XXXX, UT. Our title company, XXXX XXXX has since furnished him with rightful ownership documents. We contact XXXX regularly and in spite of him also fulfilling all requests to supply his head office with these documents relating to the correct ownership of XXXX XXXX, his attempts to help us look at refinancing the existing loan have been futile with no response forthcoming. 

I filed a previous complaint protesting the original action on the part of WF to allow such a loan but was advised in their response that we need to pursue it as a civil matter which we are doing in the XXXX XXXX civil court here in XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX. There can be no resolution in time to halt the process so, in the meantime, we plan to payoff the loan. Mortgage payoff documents have been requested by the lender. 

XXXX XXXX, HUD Certified Mortgage Modification & Rental Counselor at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Utah, whom we are consulting to help with this foreclosure, has likewise reached a closed door in contacting WF to help us modify the existing loan. We all recognize that XXXX XXXX ' name is not on the loan itself because neither he nor his deceased wife, XXXX, were responsible for making payments on the loan. XXXXXXXX XXXX loan documents specify she was responsible for insurance, property taxes and maintenance of the home and all payments apparently ceased when she quit as self-professed trustee of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX resulting in the WF foreclosure action. 

Could someone just tell me how it is that WF continued to address XXXX XXXX XXXX at her home residence of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX as demonstrated on the attached letter, when loan restrictions clearly required she be occupying the home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as her primary residence which she, in fact, never did? Can you not see how this letter demonstrates WF was complicit in "" looking the other way '' in the XXXX some years she continued to do business with Wells Fargo while maintaining two back to back loans on our home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which she falsely claimed as her primary residence? Does evidence get any clearer than this? 

Finally, it seems that CFPB has been "" left the fox guarding the henhouse '' in expecting that WF will make a fair and equitable decision to our complaints by asking them to find themselves in error to have allowed this loan in the first place. Do the right thing now!"

- Home went into foreclosure during divorce... I notified Wells Fargo that home was foreclosed. 
- Wells Fargo rewrote the loan to "" Personal Equity Loan '' and began vicious collections. 
- Wells Fargo customer service told me that the loan was written because managers do this to achieve a bonus. I told them I did not sign any documentation. 
- Loan reverted to "" Home Equity '' and vicious collections efforts resumed. I brought the account into their compliance and collections reporting and efforts ceased. 
- Notified Wells Fargo that "" Home Equity '' loan is not applicable. I do not own the home. Loan converted to "" EquityLine with Flexibility '' again without my authorization. 
- Attempted to be included in Wells Fargo class action suit. Never heard anything related to my inclusion. 
- I posted comment on my credit report and Wells Fargo responded to my complaint and listed "" Foreclosure '' after more than 7-10 years after the event and it dropped my credit rating. 
- I continue to pay {$290.00} to keep them from their relentless activities. 
* This loan should have been dissolved at the foreclosure and Wells Fargo should have reconciled with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The loan was rewritten numerous times without my authorization ( most likely to meet management performance objectives )."
5/15/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"20 years! 20 years, of knowing for a fact, as a Wells Fargo consumer, and one the millions of Americans losing everything. I have now filed complaint after complaint, with the CFPB, against Wells Fargo. I filed my original complaint, XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I received my first of many responses again, against Wells Fargo! I have now been filing complaints for 6 months. With every response from Wells Fargo, oh we are so sorry you have said this has happened to you. Has been negatively affecting our entire family for 20 years.!!! 
Like I have said from the beginning, no matter how and when the absurd amount of payments thats just disappeared over a 10-15 year blatant fraud and running a criminal enterprise freely, again, over a 20 year period. 
As stated in my first complaint. Wells Fargo has Never denied anything I have said! They only continue to tell me, they wish they could help us! 
If that was actually the case, we would have had help by now. 
With this complaint, I have the actual paperwork from the pre approved loan documents, to the internal memos and paperwork from early XXXX and up. 
The most shocking thing is I have said the exact same thing for 20 years now, only to be lied to and deceived by a company with XXXX XXXX in assets! Literally from the millions of Americans over the years. 
In the documents attached, The fraudulent and illegal activities by Wells Fargo, and XXXX XXXX! They caused the XXXX mortgage crisis. They are still, not only still perpetuating the biggest and longest running criminal enterprise in the history of the United States! The horrible reality is, they are still being allowed, by the CFPB, to confirm, never actually having to be held accountable for the years and years, of millions and billions in fines through XXXX + years of lawsuit after lawsuits. 
In the documents I have sent to you this time you will plainly see, through the hundreds of mailed mortgage statements and foreclosure notices, the American consumer, was bombarded withe endless bills and statements coming from Every Wells Fargo, and Wells Fargo home mortgage inc, Wells Fargo home mortgage, XXXX XXXX many companies that were involved and created the longest illegal criminal enterprise and activities, who have insulted themselves, again with the help and compliance from and with the very government agency, formed in XXXX, to help the American consumers from the corporations designed to help!! 
By now they are just as guilty! 
In XX/XX/XXXX, the lies and bombardment of the unimaginable amount of Wells Fargo corespondents. I have a couple years and its insane the blatant theft and cover up, of any illegal fraud and actions by any ANY and every Ponzi scheme or banks or stock markets have ever perpetuated in the entire world. 
The day we supposedly closed on XX/XX/XXXX, was illegal. As seen in said memo, prior to the actual closing. 
As soon as the fraudulent and illegal closing. We immediately began receiving multiple statements mortgage payment statements, mortgage foreclosures statements so many a forensic account and genius would and have stayed out of actually having to pay or be held accountable for the years and years of blatant theft and denial : they have had rinse and repeat cycle of millions and billions of fines and still perpetuating the biggest and longest criminal theft! 
So, even if you can come up with reasons why no help now, should all be gone. 
The illegal loan, closing and fact the mortgage company, notary, and lawyers ; did and said anything they could ; see attached internal memo, form the title company, owned and operated by Wells Fargo home mortgage inc, and other Wells Fargo companies, all companies of Wells Fargo bank na, California ; Wells Fargo bank nA, co! As seen in XXXX, as soon as the illegal loan started, literally by the second month mortgage payment and statements and foreclosure mailing from, CA, XXXX, MD, SD, NC, SC, TN, the post office box numbers that continued to poor in daily weekly and monthly. Payments after payments threatened constantly with foreclosure! A forced loan modification in XXXX! The photo copied mess I was sent, literally shows the modification in XXXX. The actual mortgage statement and run down and non payments, happen XX/XX/XXXX. Its the blatant lies and cover ups, for 25 years, never helping one American consumer, they did everything they could to rob lie and destroy the housing market the economy and its still a horrible criminal enterprise, and they are still in operation! The payments that have XXXX MD, to the late XXXX early XXXX,! Are totally inconsistent and so confusing, XXXX accident death insurance. Then out of nowhere, XXXX, mortgage statements started coming XXXX, NJ. No XXXX charge. The amount of payments late payment pending foreclosure notices! Hurt the few months out of a few and small amount of statements bills foreclosure payments bombarding consumers, In our case and Im sure millions more like us, actually worse they paid and paid only to be evicted and lose everything!!! 
The amount of financial damage will not even begin to be calculated, until Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX, and the CFPB are forced to actually pay and feel the damage of the American consumers paid suffering, the the financial damage pales in comparison to the other not seen or heard mental emotional permanently damaging so many people like myself. T he stress lies deceit purposely knowing and willingness of 2 of the biggest oldest American financial institutions ever, still being allowed to refuse help no matter what and many times or how many formally the have been guilty fines, it doesnt and hasnt deterred the years and years of protected by the government, fraud and theft. 
Its plain to see even before the illegal loan closing and proceeding theft and fraud still allowed to continue"
5/15/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem when making payments,Problem during payment process,"On XX/XX/XXXX I called up to pay off a bill on a maxed out credit card Wells Fargo and bring it up to speed. I am in the middle of divorcing, I requested that my ex-wife be removed as an authorized user and not be able to charge the account at all before I paid off the account -- as it was not a joint account, this is a reasonable request that every Wells employee agrees is reasonable. 

I was given conflicting information by multiple people at Wells Fargo and sent around a phone tree that disconnected me more than once. Finally, after getting to a Customer Service Representative, I was told my ex-wife was removed as an authorized User from the account. I was also told that in order for me not to be considered responsible for any purchases made by my ex-wife, Wells Fargo would need me to report the card lost or stolen. 
Nobody at Wells Fargo would confirm in that whole process, if making a payment would make my credit card re-activate. 

I double checked on the call what happened to interest and fees while I waited for a new card and was informed they would not be charged. I was surprised with the answer but it was clear. 

I also lodge a complaint about being bounced around and given conflicting information. The Wells Fargo Executive Office, without contacting me, investigates the complaint and closes it as resolved ( which as will be seen shortly, is manifestly incorrect ). 

Fast forward 8 days. I call Wells Fargo as a new card has not been received. I was told that the card had been cancelled at that time, despite nobody reaching out to me and my last contact was that this was the only way to resolve my account. This resulted in another case being created by the Executive Office to investigate. 
At this point it is realized that Wells Fargo sent me mail for 3 months that I never received due to divorce and nobody ever mentioned to me that my account had been moved totally to collections. Wells Fargo stated this was key information that I needed to receive and was shocked I had not received it at all nor that anybody had mentioned it to me on all of my earlier calls. 

The investigator on the second case pulled down the information from my ex-wife, supposedly removed, called her multiple times ( thus giving away the information that Wells Fargo is trying to reach me, which is my confidential information ). This demonstrates that 1 ) Wells had not fully removed the former authorized user despite receiving the instructions and telling me that was done. and 2 ) demonstrated that the person in charge of the case was not investigating the case itself. This case was escalated to the persons ' boss named XXXX, who I advised that the person given the case was not capable. He stated that she would be investigating it anyways and to give Wells 10 days. He also said he would call me back before Friday XX/XX/XXXX, the 10th business day. 

That did not occur Today is XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX called me back. On our first call I had to direct him to listen to the call where I was told a new card would be received and that interest and fees would be waived until it was. He said he could send the call. But immediately said he could not do so until they concluded the conversation when I asked to have it sent. He admitted that the original investigator had not handled my case properly. He also refused to have a conversation about resolving my account, despite agreeing with the flow of information I received. Wells Fargo apparently thinks that giving incorrect information to a client, promising them that fees and interest are waived until a card is received, cancelling that card, is perfectly acceptable -- notably they reviewed this call at the Executive offices and said it was appropriate the first time and the current review, despite going past the deadline given to me, refuses to discuss how to resolve my account. 

I do not appreciate Wells Fargo investigating their own managerial mistakes while giving me manifestly false information. Wells Fargo has most recently denied even discussing resolving my account with me on the last recorded call so that they can investigate whether their own managerial processes were followed ( note : this has nothing to do with me, as we are not disputing the information I was given, the order of events, or that the information was reviewed ). 

Please help."
5/15/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"If you had a Wells Fargo account between XXXX and XXXX, you might be one of the 16 million customers who qualify for damages, says the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

As part of a {$3.00} billion settlement, Wells Fargo has agreed to pay more than {$2.00} billion directly to customers harmed by illegal activity, ranging from incorrect overdraft fees to wrongful foreclosures, according to the CFPB. 

For bank account holders, some were incorrectly charged overdraft fees on debit and ATM withdrawals, as well as having money unfairly frozen if Wells Fargo suspected a single deposit was fraudulent. 

I had my bank account with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and I had my account frozen several times for possible "" fraudulent '' activities within this time frame. Also, I had plenty of overdraft fees within this time frame too."
5/15/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"Case number : XXXX Account number ending in : XXXX In early XXXX I submitted a claim against XXXX for {$1700.00} because they refused to give a refund originally when I submitted a claim with them. I had to call Wells Fargo to submit a dispute due to no return of service and they temporarily credited my account. Now fast forward, XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail stating that the claim has been resolved and they would reverse funds on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called in to Wells Fargo to ask them if they could pull funds on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, that way it doesnt interfere with my bills and I can also make sure Wells Fargo gets their money. They submitted a request and when I called in the next day XX/XX/XXXX, they said the request was denied. Now fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX {$1700.00} was drafted from my account. I called in to make a dispute because I didnt know who was pulling money from my account. They informed me that this occurred because of the reversal of credit and then I brought up to them that now my business account is in the negative. This is unacceptable because I was properly handling this from the beginning to make sure My account would not go negative and make sure Wells Fargo was financially taken care of too. I have a phone call verifying that Wells Fargo did a call review and did confirm that I called in to try to have them take the payment out XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX and they denied it. Yet two months later they could just randomly pull out {$1700.00}. And now Im not sure when that money will be paid back because I didnt plan for it and currently on XXXX XXXXXXXX because my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. This is crazy to me that when I try to properly handle this to make sure Wells Fargo is taken care of, they can deny it but are allowed to take out money whenever from my account without any notice?? 
I also called in multiple times to speak with a supervisor named XXXX and I asked her to send me the disclosure where it states that this is an acceptable thing for Wells Fargo to do and she refused and said I could just look it up online and she ended up hanging up on me. I told her how upset I was that Ive been a customer since 2012 and this is the response that they give for someone thats been a customer in good standing for over 10 years."

That moment I called Wells Fargo ( issuer of my stolen debit card ) that the card had been stolen and that there was already a fraudulent charge showing up on my online banking app in the amount of {$170.00}. I asked them to immediately shut down the card and issue a new one since I had no way of obtaining money. They told me a new card would arrive in 2-3 days and noted that I was disputing the {$170.00} charge that showed up that day. 

The attendant I spoke with assisted me in loading the newly issued card onto my Applepay so that I could withdraw money while I awaited the arrival of the new card. I made it absolutely clear during this conversation that my card had been stolen ( hence, why they expedited the XXXX solution during the wait for my shipped card ). 

After ten days, in a letter dated XX/XX/23, Wells Fargo denied my fraud claim and determined the fraudulent claim was authorized and asked that I consider [ my ] claim closed. 

I immediately called the number given me on the letter and spoke to an attendant who explained that since my claim stated I had my card in possession, they concluded that I made the charge. I explained over and over that I made it clear my card had been stolen at the time I reported the fraud, and that such was evidenced by the fact that the attendant even helped me set up my new card on my XXXX because they knew I had no means of withdrawing money while I waited XXXX days for a new card. 

Ive been a customer of Wells Fargo for 24 years. Im stunned by their conclusion that the card was in my possession especially given the fact that they helped me replace a card that had obviously been stolen."

Therefore, someone else received the transfer and not the person that the money was intended to. I reached out to the bank and informed them how insecure it was for users to make a transfer since there could be more than one user associated with the same phone number. They proceeded with the investigation and denied my claim. Their response was that the transfer was completed as requested to the phone number provided. Indeed, the phone number was correct but my issue was that the person that received the money was not who it was intended to. The phone number I input was correct but due to the lack of security of the system, somebody else that had the same phone number enrolled on the platform received the money. I contacted the bank in order to appeal the decision and they denied my appeal. My final action was closing all my accounts with that institution ( Wells Fargo ) since they were not able to resolve this issue."

Later when I was in an accident the car was totaled and I was still asked to pay over {$2000.00} for the remainder of what they say I owed after the insurance and other information was sent out to them. I do not remember anything done except extensions for payments.

5/16/23,Credit card or prepaid card,Store credit card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"I was charged interest incorrectly for purchases made using a Wells Fargo Retail Services card. I am not going to name the store because this isn't their fault. 

I made a purchase on XX/XX/XXXX which qualified for 0 % interest for 36 months. 
I made payments as expected until XX/XX/XXXX when I made an additional purchase in the amount of {$990.00} which did not qualify for 0 % financing. In order to avoid paying interest I made a payment for the same amount of {$990.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I had already made a payment during that billing cycle on XX/XX/XXXX to cover the minimum payment so this payment was in excess of any minimum. 

According to the CARD act of XXXX payments in excess of of the minimum must be applied to the highest interest debt first. 
According to Wells Fargo their policy is if the statement cycle hasn't closed they apply the payment to the balance from the previous statement. So they applied my payment to the 0 % balance paying it off and began charging me interest on the account at 28.99 %. Regardless of statement cycle the payment should have been allocated to the debt which is being charged at the highest interest rate. In this case the newest purchase which would receive the cards standard rate of 28.99 %, not be applied to the balance not currently being charged interest. This was not during the last two months of the promotional balance. The promotional balance did not expire until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to request a correction, and they indicated they would "" see what they can do ''. However, this policy is a clear violation of the intent and protections of the CARD act. I am submitting this complaint to prevent myself and others from being violated like this."

Additionally, when calling today to find out the claims status, the claim representative was rude and lacked empathy. She said that their investigation consists of checking in with the other persons bank, and it is a matter of he said, she said, and they trust the other banks customer.

Complaint XXXX is the latest step seeking information and resolution from Wells Fargo since XXXX, and with new urgency since XXXX, when Wells Fargo began issuing tax documents in my mother and father 's names, and as of last week, maintained an active mortgage account in their names, with annual tax assessments reported to the IRS as recently as XXXX and XXXX, despite Wells Fargo forcibly removing our family from the property in XXXX, to avoid foreclosure and after a denied loan modification after the death of co-owner, my mother, in XXXX.

5/17/23,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into a branch office to catch up on my mortgage payments for the end of the year. I am over XXXX and my benefits come at the end of the month. At the mortgage branch, the teller informed me that they have to convert mortgage payments into cash before submitting a mortgage payment.The attempted payment did not go through because the account reportedly had been moved to foreclosure status. Then the teller informed me that since the payment was not accepted, my money had to be refunded in cash. The amount was {$5000.00}. I asked to speak with a manager due to the large amount of cash and was told that the payment could not be returned to my debit card and the transaction could not be cancelled. It was XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX! I was told I had to now contact the mortgage department to get a reinstatment quote, which I did after depositing the refunded cash back into my account. The following week, I wired the reinstatement amount of {$6100.00} to the mortgage company from my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 

My complaint is that the mortgage company reported the debit as a cash advance and there was no report for the cash refund to balance out what happened that day. Everyone I contacted kept telling me that if I got the money back in cash and there should be no problem. However, no one has acknowledged that the cash money was mine in the first place and the payment was never processed at the branch. The debited transaction for the cash advance was refunded to me in cash on the spot and I received two receipts. When the debit showed up on my statement for the month, my bank would not acknowledge outside receipts that they said they could not verify.They conducted their own investigation only to determine the debit amount was valid at the time and that I did give permission for my card to be used for the payment. The mortgage company has repeatedly denied that any error was made and they contend that their teller account at the branch balanced out. I could not get anyone at the mortgage company to consider that my debited account was refunded in cash due to a cancelled payment at the time and that the debit was still kept on my statment as money they "" gave '' me. Since their policy is to do a cash advance for all mortage payments, they neglect to acknowledge that they still reported the payment to my bank and that my account was still charged {$5000.00} that was paid again in the wire transfer. The mortgage company denies that the tranaction was mishandled."

They failed to follow up with me until I went into a local branch in XXXX of XXXX, and a banker was able to escalate my case to a higher up in the company. They stated that the loan was unreported because of an issue with my co-signers address, which they never reached out to fix prior to and I was unaware was even an issue. They did initiate reporting the loan, and it did appear on my report by the end of XX/XX/XXXX as a closed auto loan account. Now, several months later as I am rebuilding my credit and reviewing all accounts on my reports, I am realizing that this loan shows absolutely no reported payment historywhich in turn did nothing to help with my credit. There are at least 10-11 on time payments that are missing from the now reported auto loan.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, the controller of Pentagon Properties, logged into her personal account and her sons account. Her personal accounts are also linked to the corporate XXXX Mortgage account # XXXX ( new account # XXXX ) held by XXXX XXXX. She noticed that her son had XXXX transactions for {$450.00} each that she didnt recognize dated XX/XX/XXXX. Her son called Wells Fargo immediately that day and disputed the charges. His funds were returned to the account 12 days after the dispute. 

The following week, she received a business debit card from XXXX. She called XXXX and told them she never ordered that card and that they needed to close it. XXXX XXXX took a picture of the card and shredded it at the office. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, she pulled the statement for the business account ( XXXX XXXX  ) and noticed that there were transactions that she didnt recognize that amounted to {$20000.00}. These transactions looked like the same transactions in her sons personal account. She immediately contacted the bank and filed a fraud report. The unauthorized withdrawals were done on different dates and in different amounts. She checks this corporate account once per month when she prints the statements the first week of each month. 

These transactions show the name from a company named XXXX XXXX XXXX. On the transactions, it shows that the customer is XXXX XXXX who is her son. In reviewing spam folder of her personal e-mail account, she found an invoice for {$2300.00}. This amount was taken 7 times on the business account plus another of {$4100.00}. The fraudulent withdrawal from this account amounts to {$20000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX notified Wells Fargo of the incident. A Wells Fargo employee named XXXX called back on XX/XX/XXXX, to let us know that the case was closed. XXXX said that she would escalate to the executive department. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX called and informed us that these transactions have no protection unless disputed within XXXX4 hours. We have since appealed to the Small Business Resolution team with the same response. 

We are reaching out to you as a last resort to compel Wells Fargo to treat its customers fairly and to hopefully improve its lax security measures. Due to Wells Fargos failure to provide two-factor authentication measures, the unknown third party obtained access to XXXX XXXX accounts XXXX including the XXXX XXXX  corporate account. But for the absence of adequate security measures, the unknown third party would not have been able to withdraw corporate funds linked to XXXX XXXX account. By refunding XXXX XXXX sons account but refusing to refund money stolen from a different account linked to XXXX XXXX account, Wells Fargo has shown its bad faith. 

We would appreciate your attention to this matter and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution. We are very disappointed in Wells Fargos handling of this matter. If we are unable to resolve this matter, we will be forced to take alternative steps, up to and including, contacting the media to report Wells Fargos practices and the treatment of its customers.

On XXXX at XXXX XXXXhe machine stopped working and I called the Wells Fargo merchant department to ask what was happening. In that call I am informed that supposedly a client called VISA and gave a complaint about my Business where he said that customers were required a minimum for their purchases, and they were also charged a surcharge. All this is false, I told Wells Fargo that I had proof that XXXX XXXX doesn't do those things and I personally went to the bank and spoke to business banker XXXX XXXX and showed him the receipts for the sales every day before Wells Fargo told me the false accusation, sales of {$0.00}, of {$1.00}, of {$1.00}, of {$1.00}, many receipts from different transactions and different days and different people. On XXXX  the sale of cards for the whole day was {$770.00}, which money was not deposited to my Account. on XXXX at XXXX  I call Wells Fargo to see why the deposit did not enter My account and the respond was that I was fined {$5000.00} dollars for said ( false ) accusations. I immediately went to the bank and XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that he could not do anything more than what he had already done because the merchant department was a superior entity, from there I went out to find a legal representative and with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I put a Demand Letter to Wells Fargo to which they responded without presenting evidence of why they were acting like this against My business and without giving me the right to mediate and review mine and their evidence of Innocence. I return to the Law Firm, and I told them that I wanted to continue with a Civil Lawsuit with a judge in the Court and we made a new contract. After XXXX days, they call me from the firm and said they were going to cancel the contract and return the money I had paid them because Wells Fargo resides in the state of Texas and My lawyers do not have jurisdiction there because the Firm is from XXXX. I do not understand if I live in XXXX. Florida and the business is in XXXX and Wells Fargo is in XXXX why do I have to go to the state of Texas to be able to take Wells Fargo before a Judge and make them pay for the monetary damage they are causing me. Since XXXX, my business is only selling Cash, I can not use the card machine because the bank withholds the Money, they withheld {$770.00} on XXXX and {$89.00} on XXXX, which is when I stopped the sales by credit cards. Many customers who continue to come to My business and must now buy cash and are willing to talk to explain how they buy in the Store and show that Wells Fargo is taking an unfair action Against My Business and against My family economy to the point of almost being bankrupt. I am providing you with a copy of my receipts, the correspondence received from Wells Fargo and correspondence from the attorney. 
I am not in agreement with the stance Wells Fargo has taken against my business because I am not guilty of their accusations, and I will greatly appreciate it if you can review my case and advise what steps need to be taken to resolve this issue.

We stopped paying our mortgage for 3 months and called again. They sent paperwork for me to complete and fax to them. I had faxed this information several times, in which they said the paperwork was old and that I needed to send this information again. This went on for months. In XXXX of XXXX Wells Fargo stated that we were not denied the modification and because we did not send in the paperwork they foreclosed on us.

XXXX failed to follow the requirements of the correspondent agreement that required that a DOT be recorded and the Assignment of DOT be recorded at XXXX XXXX XXXX of Deeds. So on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX submitted and had accepted my loan into their XXXX XXXX XXXX without having title recorded which made the loan disqualified for the XXXX XXXX as all loans accepted into a XXXX XXXX must have title recorded. XXXX had used the required UCC3 procedure in endorsing the mortgage loan Note in blank as does ever loan pooled must have done giving XXXX ownership of the Note, but not the debt which XXXX can not purchase per US Congress that prevents XXXX from buying or selling a mortgage loan. XXXX to cover up their error did on XX/XX/XXXX have record the DOT while not having any financial interest in the loan, making it an illegal claim of a debt owed to them when in fact they been paid off in full on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, write a Limit Power of Attorney ( POA ) to address the failure to provide XXXX with the required documents, which was written by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells took over servicing my loan on XX/XX/XXXX which they became in possession of my complete file through the purchasing of mortgage servicing rights of XXXX XXXX Fed Gov Back loans. Starting around the country on or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX started assigning the DOT to XXXX XXXX Fed Gov mortgage back loan to Wells which rapped up around XX/XX/XXXX. Now my loan was not assigned at that time but while Wells was servicing my loan XXXX did have recorded the POA on XX/XX/XXXX, which of the only 4 loans originated by XXXX in XXXX XXXX my loan was the only loan that did not have an Assignment of DOT recorded. XXXX was declared a "" failed bank '' on XX/XX/XXXX, and stopped existing. XXXX not existing did not file for bankruptcy and never called my loan due as it was not in default and did not have an Assignment of DOT, leaving no other entity with a financial interest in the loan originated on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells sent this issue to an outside attorney as if XXXX owned the debt which they did not, and the law firm in XXXX & XXXX who's employee Attorney XXXX XXXX moonlighting as XXXX  Assistant Secretary fraudulently created the Assignment of DOT XX/XX/XXXX granting Wells with a lien against my property as it they purchased a debt that ended on XX/XX/XXXX! Wells would act as if they were the lender with the Notice of Default and Assignment of DOT and was not until a week or so before the foreclosure admit they were not the lender and said an investor was the owner of the debt. A year after the foreclosure Wells writes that XXXX was the investor, which investor in non-judicial terms is the owner of the debt. XXXX never held a debt from me. With the Wells 's fraudulent actions it prevent action by me to solve this issue as with a modification or bankruptcy because Wells was not honest about the situation and is why they did not process my file for the HAMP or VA HAMP because there was no counterparty in this matter. The Dept of VA was also victimized because it used federal dollars to purchase my property from a party they did not own any debt as in XXXX, and it in return sold they stolen goods to another party!

After the 14th business day and still no refund I asked again and the tracking then showed that my package was lost and/or the courier was disposing of it. 

After alerting XXXX XXXX of this, they said they would file a claim with XXXX regarding this issue, but they would not be refunding me if they did not receive the return. They told me to wait another 7-16 business days this time. 

After the 16th additional business day, XXXX XXXX told me that XXXX denied their claim and stated that I would now have to file a claim with XXXX  or with my bank for the funds.

After reaching out to XXXX to file claim, XXXX would not allow me to file a claim because the merchant already opened up 2 claims on this tracking ID and that was their limit.

5/18/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Fee problem,"I have had a credit card checking account and savings account ( XXXX ) with Wells Fargo. All closed. When I tried to open the savings, was told it was mandatory that I deposit {$25.00} a month for it to remain open as a viable account ; This proved a financial strain and some stress. I eventually closed and withdrew what savings I had in it. It was a news item that fake accounts were being opened by Wells Fargo employees and false information given out in order to meet some quota which many employees did to protect their jobs. This is public record. In other words, the door was opened to fraud. I, among others, was lied to and mislead. I contacted them about this and how I had been caught in the web of this fraud. I heard from them in XXXX and was given {$1500.00} as compensation and told that I was still eligible for arbitration. They also read to me a list other accounts I was alleged to have opened or applied for including an application for homeowners insurance, something for which I never applied. 

They provided a hearing, XX/XX/XXXX with a mediator and one of WF 's personnel. My understanding of having a neutral mediator was that she or he would hear all sides and make a determination. This "" mediation '' was no more than having a messenger going back and forth with proposals and offers which I could have handled by myself. They contend that I never made one of those {$25.00} payments and sent the mediator and I paperwork as "" proof. '' It's not true, or I would not have gone back to close the account as being a hardship and part of the pressure they put on employees to open accounts ( even bogus ). There is no reason not to suspect and believe that the above paperwork was not doctored especially in view of their known fraudulent practices. When I filled out the forms, in the space for compensation, I entered {$25000.00} which would minimal considering the material and personal toll dealing with them took. 
Finally, the mediation, such as it was, ended with a measly, insulting {$150.00}. I can and will continue with my pursuit of justice which will include media and through the legal system, or they can adjust this now and be done with it. 


Considering their history and reputation there is no reason not to believe they doctored my account in their favor removing any mention of {$25.00} payments. In fact, I most likely would have allowed that account to exist had they not taken {$25.00} from my checking. I closed the account taking out the {$350.00} deposit plus any {$25.00} payments. They have contended that the {$25.00} per month was a fee. It was not. I was explicitly told and pressured that I was required to deposit at least this amount every month Former employees of Wells Fargo have spoken of a toxic high-pressure sales culture at the bank drove some workers to deceive customers and open unauthorized accounts even in the bank 's own headquarters building in XXXX XXXX XXXX 
Wells Fargo is embroiled in a scandal for taking advantage of customers by opening as many as 2 million accounts without their consent. This bank has as recently as XXXX XXXX been in the news again regarding their practices.

Also for some reason it is their policy to mail a check when the amount is over {$10000.00} instead of doing a transfer. XXXX XXXX states they are not responsible because they mailed the check in plenty of time to get to Wells Fargo. 

I have requested from both banks that they provide the postmark date. Both banks say they are not willing/able to do that. 

I requested from XXXX to pay Wells Fargo in a timely manor. I followed all of the rules outlined and made the request in a timely manor. Neither bank is willing to take responsibility for this error, and I can not determine who is at fault. Did Wells Fargo misplace the check and cash it late or did XXXX send the check late."

The return email address was not wellsfargo.com. but instead XXXX. Upon independent verification by phone Wells Fargo at a known number they indicate the transfer of mortgage servicer is taking place on XX/XX/2023 and emailed me a pdf letter with the date of XX/XX/2023. I received no notice or alert about this letter being generated and have not received the letter by mail - I would there for have no reason to go looking for it. 

It is my opinion that this process is not in compliance with 12 CFR Part 1024 ( Regulation X ) Subpart A - General Provisions 1024.33 and should not be occurring on XX/XX/2023 because proper notice was not given. Posting a pdf letter to an online account is NOT NOTICE - there is no reason for me to check this account every day looking for notices - notice requries a positive action to reach out to me by the financial institution which did not happen here. 

Reading about the new servicer there appear to be signs of growing too fast with many consumers falling victim to the transfer process and very poor communication resulting in negative credit reporting actions as well as delinquencies when none would have existed without the transfer occurring. This is a sign of a problem that CFPB should address. 

I contacted the new servicer who states that I may not be able to make a payment with them on XXXX XX/XX/2023 due to delays in setup of the account- this is not acceptable and again does not appear to comply with 12 CFR Part 1024 ( Regulation X ) Subpart A - General Provisions 1024.33."

I was told that I could repay the part of the loan that I stil owed from the forbearance period, at the end of my mortgage payment. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not pay back {$4000.00} in one payment. 
I was even offered another forbearance loan after this forbearance period ended. I didnt want to have too much to owe back, so I declined the 2nd forbearance offer.

In response, I told them I understood that I was not required to pay the forbearance sum in a large lump sum. I believe that the payments of principal and interest would not be changed, and that I would owe on the the loan for a few more months. 
Wells Fargo responded with many different answers. I have them in writing and I have recorded many of the responses. The first response from Wells Fargo was that I need to open a new account that would "" serve my needs better '' This new modified loan would need me to fill out a new mortgage loan application and fo through the entire process of getting a new loan. I was very upset. I told them many times that I didnt want a new mortgage loan account. I asked for them to please just let me pay at the back of the loan, like I was promised. This was never answered. 

Instead Wells Fargo placed an outstanding balance of over {$4000.00} on my mortgage loan account. I continued to pay the monthly premium of {$350.00} by the XXXX  of every month. I noticed that my payments were now not being credited to my principal and my interest. Instead the entire {$350.00} was being credited ONLY to my interest.

This practice of transferring mortgages to a different servicer without consulting the consumer and getting permission, is not fair to the consumer.

But there was no information provided for the {$40000.00}. 
Wells Fargo refused to take responsibility for this Unauthorized Fraudulent wire transferring, and refused to pay me back this {$40000.00} caused by its negligence. 
In Wells Fargos Deposit Account agreement page 19, it says : we will follow a security procedure to verify an instruction to send a funds transfer from your account, whether we received the instruction in person, in writing, by phone, or online or mobile, Wells Fargo failed to do their job to verify the transactions with me, neither by my cellphone, nor by my landline home phone. 
Wells Fargo should return my {$40000.00} back to me."
5/23/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Bank made a debit to my account in the amount of {$1300.00} for "" Transaction Correction - Mobile deposit check posted twice - REF # XXXX. '' On a call to their customer service department I was told that my Wells Fargo ATM deposit on XX/XX/XXXX was being returned because the name in the payee blank did not match my full name. I have deposited a check in that amount with an identical payee name nearly every week between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX of this year and the check had never been denied for that reason. I was told I would receive a letter and the check in the mail. 

I received a letter on XXXX saying that a check I deposited in the amount of {$1300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX was deposited a second time on XX/XX/XXXX. First, there is no second deposit of this check on any of my bank statements or in the transactions shown in mobile banking. Second, Wells Fargo credited that mobile deposit on XX/XX/XXXX and they then debited my account in the same amount on the same day and it is listed as "" DEPOSITED ITEM RETN UNPAID - PAPER XXXX ''. 

On the letter I was sent, both the alleged XX/XX/XXXX transaction as well as the fictitious transaction from XX/XX/XXXX have sequence numbers. The fictitious transaction has a sequence number that is XXXX. The real transaction has a sequence number of XXXX. I don't think it is coincidence that the fictitious transaction has a sequence number that doesn't match their standard format. I was told by a helpful bank officer in one of their branches that the fictitious all nine 's number can't be right. 

I was given a reference number XXXX, So, they debited my account {$1300.00} without notifying me for a check I deposited that they did not credit to my account. 

I have filed a complaint and a dispute of my transaction. I was told that most disputes are handled in 3-4 business days, but some take longer. I have asked them to credit the amount they debited on XX/XX/XXXX pending the resolution of this dispute. They refused that reasonable request. All of this took over 5 hours of phone calls where I was constantly transferred to different departments most of which could not help me. The level of incompetence boggles the mind. 

I do not believe that I am the only victim of a similar complaint."
5/23/23,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Card opened as result of identity theft or fraud,"Already made an FTC Complaint ( XXXX ) against Wells Fargo bank for issuing me a Master Card that I did not ask for. Went into a branch and complained that I been issued a card in error/fraud. They told me that they will take care of it. I had put in a credit freeze with XXXX and XXXX. Weeks after Wells Fargo acknowledged that they had taken care of it and canceled my Master card, I receive a communication from Wells Fargo yesterday XXXX saying that they are trying to open another credit card in my name ( that I did not request ) - Application # is XXXX. In this letter Wells Fargo is asking me to 'unfreeze ' my Credit so they can complete processing my credit card application!!! 

Wells Fargo is the XXXX  of the earth. I will not touch them with a 10 foot pole. What do I need to do to make them go away for good?"

All three transactions were not made by me, nor do I know who the subjects are. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and made an identity theft and fraud complaint. Week later I received a letter stating that they determined I sent those transactions. I called and spoke to a representative who stated I used my mobile app to send the transaction. Ive called multiple times disputing their finding. I attempted to appeal their decision and was told I was not able to. Another representative confirmed my two numbers on my account. After receiving their evidence on how they determined I was at fault I reviewed all documents. It was determined that someone hacked into my account using a desktop computer added a Georgia cell phone number and transferred these transaction. After filing another executive complaint I have yet to hear back from Wells Fargo. I have also filed a police report."

5/24/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,This is a FRUAD issue however there wasnt a checkbox for that so I checked the box that was similar. On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed I had {$2700.00} was taken out of my account I called my bank Wells Fargo to figure out what was going on and the phone rep said there was a check cashed in that amount I told her it wasnt me and she said she would have to transfer me to the claim department to file a claim which I did. When she transferred me to do so I was told the same thing that there was a check that was altered and cashed on XX/XX/XXXX and was taken on XX/XX/XXXX and she was not able to give me further information. She said to be patient and gave me a claim number that it would take 5 bs days to gather some information I was never offered a credit while they researched nothing. I waited 2 days and called back and had to go through 5 different reps because they didnt have the claim number I was given and said I never filled a claim this went on for 4 weeks. I kept calling giving them the same information and was given a different claim number every time. They kept giving me different information as well so I decided to call there Corp Phone number who then foiled another claim they really didnt k ow what was going on eighter. I had to go trough so many reps this went on for a month in half untill I finally had a XXXX from there executive claim team to help. He told he the same that a altered check was cashed in my name I told him I filed a police report and I filed with ID theft too. He said that someone went in the bank and cashed the check using an ID again I told him it wasnt me and I had plenty of proof I also asked if he could have the bank pull the camera footage to prove this. He said he reached out to the bank Wells Fargo in XXXX CA where it happened and asked for footage and it would take some time 2 months later Im still dealing with this he finally reached back to me when I called every couple of days for info and said that the bank hasnt given him an answer and I would have to call the police to get the footage myself he was very rude. I called the XXXX police department where I filled my police report and told them what he said and they said that the bank has to be the one to get the footage. I need help the money that was taken from me is my savings I needed to bury my mother and I dont know what to do. Ive spoke to over 15 different reps had an executive rep XXXX to be told he cant help me and they are not giving me back my money. This is all stance. I also asked him if the check is altered what was the name that it was altered from and who was the check from he told me it was a Insurance company XXXX XXXX. So I XXXX  this company and called and spoke with there fraud department and gave them the information XXXX gave me and they said that check was Voided XX/XX/XXXX and had a different name on it. I have there information if you need. Theres a lot more to this. I have all my proof it wasnt me and need my money back that was taken Wells Fargo has been rude and unprofessional with this matter.
5/24/23,Checking or savings account,Other banking product or service,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Transaction was not authorized,"On XX/XX/2023 there were 6 withdrawals from my checking account at Wells Fargo bank in $ XXXX increments totaling {$5700.00}. 
We reported it to the bank on the XXXX when we first saw it. Bank made no attempt to inform us that this happened and being that it overdrew my account, they should have seen the red flag. I have banked with them for 29 years and through reviewing my history, they can see that I wouldn't do this. 
The bank refuses to give me details about these withdrawals saying they will let us know in 30 days. They also have come to the conclusion that the withdrawals were made by us, which they were not, nor was there any authorization to withdraw. I suspect identity theft. 
We have found on our own that the entity who removed the funds was XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
We don't and have never dealt with stocks or bonds, and we certainly wouldn't overdraw our account to invest in this. 
Our income is Social Security. 
I have spoken with many bank employees at the bank and even went to the bank to see if this problem can be resolved, and each say they can't divulge the info. and therefore I am unable to resolve it with the thief. 
I do have a fraud claim # XXXX. I received a letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2023 stating that the case was closed and they will take no further action. 
Thank you."
5/24/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Late or other fees,"We discovered that Wells Fargo has been charging our account a $ XXXX fee due to our account balance below an excessive threshold {$250000.00}. When we inquired why this fee is being assessed, we were informed that Wells Fargo converted our account without our consent to a new account that enforces a minimum balance of {$250000.00}. We have since tried to reverse these charges because the account conversion was made WITHOUT OUR CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. 

We have also since tried to reverse these fees, which Wells Fargo has only done for a portion because they claim that they do not see these fees charged to our account. We have pulled the online monthly statements clearly showing where the fees are being charged and deducted automatically from our account, but Wells Fargo have refused to accept they have done so - and also refusal to review our monthly statements showing these unauthorized charges."

5/24/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Wells Fargo put our home into foreclosure without notifying us. 
On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX law office with a copy of a Wells Fargo statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. This statement showed a balance of {$21000.00} which was due on XX/XX/XXXX. We never received this statement by standard mail or certified mail prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout the following week we tried to review what assets we could liquidate that would pay the overdue balance. However, on XX/XX/XXXX we received a hand written notice of the Sheriff 's sale of our home. We were shocked when we received that notice. Wells Fargo was legally obligated to notify us of this important notice and to have documentation that we received the notice with our signatures before starting action against us. Such an important notice should have been sent by certified mail.They denied us the opportunity to create a plan to obtain the funds or to make a repayment plan before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. We were completely blindsided by their actions. We have been making mortgage payments for nearly 19 years abs do not want to lose our home. 
I have attached the XX/XX/XXXX statement. On page 2, in bold print it states that we are 135 days behind and they had NOT started filings against us. There us no warning whatsoever that foreclosure proceedings would start on XX/XX/XXXX if it was not paid. They were obligated to give notice prior to XX/XX/XXXX of the intent to forclosure. The wording is deceptive and misleading. There should be a clearly worded statement in this mailing warning us of imminent forclosure. 
This company has faced large fines for fraud and illegal foreclosures We are now victims of their deceptive and reckless behavior We were not given opportunity to present a repayment plan, a loan modification or a chance to make smaller payments. 
I believe that their actions may be retaliatory. Early into the mortgage we received harassing phone calls from the company. They would verbally abuse us and scream at us on the phone claiming that our payment was late. At the time of these calls, we had documentation that the payment had been made on time and received by the company well within the Grace period. We documented these calls and reported the harassment to Minnesota Attorney General, XXXX XXXX. She wrote them a letter prohibiting them from calling us. 
For the past several months, they have called several times a day. These calls are very upsetting. I had such a horrible experience with them in the past and I am afraid to speak with them When we purchased our home we were forced to take out 2 loans. One was a 30 year fixed mortgage the other had a variable rate. They did not give an explanation ; they said we had to do it that way to get the home. We really loved the house and they said we had to finance it that way. We were told at closing that the 2nd loan would have a Ballon payment. The balloon payment of {$140.00} was due in XXXX 
We weren't able to make the payment and could not find lender that wanted to finance what they call a "" second mortgage '' We considered selling the home at that time, but the property value had decreased considerably and would have a big loss. We have not had much communication from the about the loan since then. I found out in XXXX that they had changed us over {$30000.00} in fees and are charging us {$70.00} a day. I have attached a recent statement. It states that were owe XXXX but payment due is {$0.00}. Nowhere on the letter does it state that we are being charged these fees. 
We were forced to take out this type of loan and their reasons for financing it that way was not explained. 
What they did to us us wrong. 
We are desperately trying to sell our house as soon as possible. 
We should not have to pay these exorbitant extra fees. 
We are asking for your help. We do not want to lose our home to forclosure."

The person ( s ) who stole the check was possibly a tenant paying rent at my residence. I believe they also stole my drivers license and used it to open an account in my name, and then mobile deposited the life insurance check for which i was the beneficiary.

Wells Fargo states that reimbursement lies solely on the issuer of the check XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ive contacted XXXX XXXX via telephone but never recieved any response in resolving this matter. In the telephone call with XXXX XXXX I was told by XXXX XXXX that Wells Fargo was at fault and that they would have to reimburse since they were negligent. In other words both the issuer of the check and the bank that cashed the check are refusing to help. At the time said check was stolen, and subsequently negotiated fraudulently, i was XXXX.

5/25/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Fee problem,Unfair overdraft practices from XXXX XXXX
5/25/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,None,"In XXXX of XXXX, I requested XXXX relief forbearance from Wells Fargo for my mortgage that originated in XX/XX/XXXX. During the process, I was 1 month ahead on my mortgage. This request was in result of losing my employment. Before settling on forbearance as an option, I called Wells Fargo multiple times to confirm that this would not hinder my credit score, Wells Fargo Payment History, and ability to apply for products or have PMI removed. On multiple calls, Wells Fargo agents informed me that my credit and Wells Fargo History would not be hindered by this process. 

I went into XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, I began the process of exiting forbearance. I had requested that the balance due be placed on the back of my mortgage as a ballon type payment due at the end of the loan or at sale. The only communication that I received from Wells Fargo closing the terms of the forbearance was a letter stating that i was eligible for the amount to be placed on the back of my loan. On a call, i agreed to those terms. No other information was provided to me about the forbearance other than the terms of repayment which was the balloon payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, i received an escrow re-analysis that increased my payment to {$1700.00} from {$1500.00}. Of course, you can see how this increase can be concerning. I called in and asked why it had been increased. Wells Fargo informed me that they had received notification that the property taxes and homeowners insurance had gone up. 

I immediately started shopping around for new homeowners insurance and ensured that the Home Stead exemption was placed on my property. This would in turn reduce my property taxes. 

I called Wells Fargo and asked them why I had an escrow shortage of {$6000.00}. They informed me that it was because of the loan modification. Wells Fargo moved a portion of my owed Escrow balance to the back of my loan. They did not specify what amount that was or what was it that contributed to the full amount. They did not process an escrow reanalysis at the time of closing the loan modification which caused me to have that shortage. 

I called and asked Wells Fargo multiple times what was it that made up the full balance of what was placed on the back of my loan. Many agents later provided me with a detailed list of the charges that were moved to the back of the loan. 

I then asked Wells Fargo why I had a shortage if the escrow balance was paid to the back of my loan. They informed me on a call that it was because an escrow reanalysis had not been completed for over a year and I had not been paying enough into my escrow account. As you can tell this was not good news to hear since it would drastically change my monthly expenses without warning considering there was a way to avoid this. 

I reduced my homeowner 's premium and property taxes. In addition, i had my home reappraised because the expected loan-to-value ratio I had calculated on my home was less than 80 %, including the balloon payment. 

I was severely dissatisfied with the way the escrow account had been managed. So I requested the escrow account to be deleted after I was able to bring it current with a payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, i spoke to an agent who informed me that I only had to pay {$1900.00} for the escrow account to be considered for deletion. I made the payment and requested the deletion. 

I called back days later to ask where the process was. They declined the request stating that I had missed payments of over 60 days in the last 2 years. To my surprise, I asked when I had missed payments and the agent informed me that all the forbearance payments were considered missed payments. This information was never provided to me previous to entering into forbearance. I was even informed by agents to ignore the letters in the mail because they were no longer accurate because they are on an automated system. 

Of course, I requested that this be reviewed again because in none of the conversations that I had with Wells Fargo was I informed of the missed payments. 

During this escalation process, I had my home reappraised and Wells Fargo removed my PMI because I met the less than 80 % loan-to-value ratio. This was removed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

A few days after my request for a review of the decline, I called back to check the status. An agent by the name of XXXX informed me that I would need to be moved to the XXXX department for my complaint. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with the executive representative XXXX. She informed me that she would be reviewing the case and that I would get a response by XX/XX/XXXX. On that call, I requested all call transcriptions since the month of XXXX of XXXX due to the continued misinformation that I had received from multiple different people. I also requested the specific reasons why my escrow deletion was being declined. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received the letter with my deletion reasons stating "" at this time your account does not meet escrow deletion requirements due to the loan-to-value ratio greater than 80 % as well you have had a completed modification ( XXXX payment deferral ) I called for 2 days to XXXX and left VM. No callbacks. I then spoke to her manager. I was understanding about the Loan-to-value ratio because I had assumed that at the time of review, the appraisal might have not gone through. But I needed more information about the reason for "" completed modification ''. I asked XXXX 's manager to provide me with in-depth information on what that meant because i had never received written or verbal communication that this would affect my escrow account, other than the balloon payment. I informed the manager that I had since had the property appraised and because of this, I would like the decision reviewed because one of the requirements stipulated in the letter should no longer apply. She agreed. 

In this letter, Wells Fargo also declined to provide me with all call transcripts and information about the calls that I had made over the past 2 years. They saw it as an unreasonable request. I didn't expect to have been lied to so many times in a row and not keep records of all the calls. 

Another case was opened that day with the executive department with an agent called XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX. I called this agent to receive an update on my request. He informed me that the reason for my decline was due to late payments and the loan-to-value ratio. I asked why the Loan-to-value ratio was still showing as a higher percentage when i already had the property appraised. He said that its because of another loan-to-value ratio and did not provide specifics. Which made no sense and I was also never informed of it. When I asked about the late payments he said that the questions i had asked on previous calls are irrelevant because he is telling me that Wells Fargo took it as late payments, even though they were in forbearance and i had never been informed otherwise. 

He informed me that I needed to abide by the requirements of the investor into the loan since Wells Fargo had sold my loan to XXXX XXXX. I did not agree to this. I also asked previously on a call if this sale would affect my loan performance or requirements. I signed a loan contract with Wells Fargo, Not XXXX XXXX. The Wells Fargo agent at the time informed me that I only needed to uphold the requirements of my loan document. 

When i asked XXXX this information, he declined to answer. When i asked to speak to his manager, he declined to answer, when i asked to speak to anyone else, he declined to answer. 

I have been lied to by multiple people for well over 2 years now and no one has given me any straight answers. These continued misinformation and lies can be considered unfair and deceptive practices that made me agree to a forbearance that hindered my financial future. Wells Fargo has a proven track record of deceiving customers and this type of experience proves why."
5/25/23,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo did a money wire to XXXX in New York for XXXX XXXX XXXX.

XXXX said they transferred the money already to XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo said nothing can be done and closed the wire fraud claim. Thats not acceptable. I called the and requested an affidavit for fraud and forgery. They have been unresponsive to my requests. They said theyd send me the documents why they closed the case. I am the one that notified them of XXXX XXXX being a fraudulent company. I asked for the XXXX address and phone number in New York and they said they would check on that.

I have experienced trying to use my debit card knowing I have cash available in my checking account. And I get declined. And the cash I have available is taken by Wells Fargo.

5/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem caused by your funds being low,Overdrafts and overdraft fees,Wells Fargo has been misleading its customers into believing they have more money available in their checking accounts than they do unfairly charging them overdraft fees when they consequently overdraw their accounts.
5/26/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"In the late evening of XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX, I attempted to withdrawal XXXX $ from a Wells Fargo ATM in XXXX , California . The ATM machine denied the transaction, stating on the screen that the machine did not have enough XXXX $ bills to dispense my requested amount. Soon afterwards, I was able to perform another attempted transaction, which I did, and was able to withdrawal XXXX $ in XXXX $ bill denominations. The following day, the online statement for Wells Fargo showed that I had made 2 separate transactions for the amount of XXXX $ total. I proceeded to call Wells Fargo to confirm if this was correct and they stated it was based on their records. At that point, I filed a dispute of the initial transaction with Wells Fargo. Subsequently, the claim was denied approximately 2 weeks later. I called back their claims department to file another complaint to follow up on their decision to deny the claim and my follow up claim has also been denied. According to Wells Fargo, by denying my claim, they are claiming that I withdrew XXXX $ that evening by 2 separate transactions. However, this is not possible and defies logic, considering I have a maximum withdraw limit of XXXX $ per day with Wells Fargo. Therefore, this is the reason for filing my complaint today with consumer financial protection bureau."

I asked them why would I give someone that information and then come to the bank and file a claim on the same day it happened. I was told that wire transfers take place in real time and that there was nothing that they could do.

5/26/23,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"As I conveyed to you today XXXX XXXX contacted me on Tuesday, XX/XX/2023 he asked me how much I could pay for rent that he was an Owner of some apartment buildings. He gave me the address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and told me to call him at XXXX once I arrived at the building. He said that the apartment was unregistered and he would charge me {$1100.00} a month. I explained in the XXXX ad that as a good faith gesture I could pay the security deposit and up to 3 months rent but I couldn't pay no more than {$1100.00} and I was temping and looking for another job so at this time I wasn't working. 

When I arrived at the building I actually saw XXXX sitting on the steps across the street where he said he lived in a senior building. He opened the door and took me upstairs to the 3rd floor and I looked at the apartment. XXXX called him while I was actually in the apartment and I spoke to him from XXXX 's phone. I told him I liked the apartment. He said it was the XXXX holiday and I needed to put something down. I withdrew XXXX cashier 's checks for {$1100.00} from my Wells Fargo account and deposited them into account number XXXX at XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He then called on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and said he had met with the other Owners and they needed another deposit of {$1100.00}. I went to Wells Fargo and did the same, depositing the XXXX check into the same XXXX XXXX and same account number. Although, he wanted me to deposit this last check into a XXXX XXXX which I never did because he said he would deposit the last check back into my account and then I could write him another check. I refused then he started getting upset and said obviously I didn't want the apartment. 

I had called XXXX on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX and asked him if the apartment was still available. He said someone was living in the apartment. When I told XXXX he became upset and said I had no business calling XXXX that the apartment was being held for me. 

XXXX, I have filled out an application, a copy of my driver 's license, he has my social security number, I forwarded my bank statement and I sent them to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I texted him ( XXXX XXXX and asked for my money to be immediately deposited back into my account via XXXX and that I was going to take him to court.

Any help would be greatly appreciated since you know him."
5/26/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,None,This is part of the Wells Fargo claims. I refinanced my home mortgage with them in XXXX and paid the loan in XXXX. I do not believe it was reviewed with the other class action lawsuits because the loan was paid in full. I would like it to be reviewed as part of the settlement. I believe this because when I reached out to Wells Fargo to obtain the loan number last month they infomercial it would take two full months to get the number ( which is ridiculous because I can obtain my XXXX orders from two years ago in 15 seconds! ). If my loan information was so hidden I dont think they reviewed it.

Around XX/XX/2022, my phone was stolen which contained not only banking passwords but passwords for everything like social media accounts, cryptocurrency accounts, emails, etc. I didnt think twice about the passwords or any of that information I figured they wouldnt be able to get into my phone and find the passwords but they did and these transactions from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX were not made by me. I finally noticed on XX/XX/XXXX because the transactions were so close together and just that day alone there was over {$1000.00} in transactions and my bank never contacted me once to confirm they were from me. I didn't hear back about my claim until XX/XX/2022. Wells Fargo denied my claim and when I called they said it was denied because the merchant stated that these transactions were real and that Wells Fargo believes these transactions were from me. They said there was nothing I could do but contact the merchant I tried contacting XXXX again but they said there is nothing they can do. I filed a claim with the cfpb but nothing was done. I let this situation go figuring I'll just take the loss but after talking to family friends who are lawyers they said I should file another claim with the cfpb so that is what I am doing. I hope something will get done about it this time."

The transactions first went pending and in a day or two were authorized. I tried contacting the Police about the same and was told that I'd need to get a subpoena to gain access to the ATM footage. Since then, I've constantly been in touch with my bank trying to get my money back. I submitted a claim which after investigation was rejected. I provided the bank with screenshots and nothing has happened so far. I have an email from the bank stating that they suspected unusual activity on my account.

On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, I wanted to sell my washer and dryer, so i posted a list on XXXX XXXX to sell them for {$500.00} ( Both ). And then, around XXXX, a women contact me on XXXX XXXXXXXX, and said that she wants them and her stepson would pick it up tomorrow, so she want pay me before he comes and she don't have cash. so, i agree to use zell. After that, scam began. Firstly, she said she needs my email address to verify my account. so i tell her. Then, she said she has sent XXXX to my zelle account and showed screenshot to me. and then, i got a email from "" zell support ( fake ) '' says "" {$500.00} is above my limit '', so she and i need transfer another {$200.00} at the same time to release the funds. in this period, she pretended she has got a same email and tricked me to send {$200.00}. after I sent it to the account that email provide, another email sent to me and she said she got the same email, which said due to technical issue she and i have to send another {$200.00} to get whole refund ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). and then same trick happened again. 
At last, i was induced to transfer {$1700.00} ( XXXX ) to 4 different account ( fake agent account ) until i recognize this scam. 
2.after that, around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, i connected customer service of my bank-Wellsfargo because i use zell function inside wellsfargo App. And then, one agnet heard what happened to me and submit my claim to bank 's system. 
3.after that, they began investigation, they didn't ask me any files or record during their investigation in the following 10 days. 
4.XXXX  XXXX, i got mail from wellsfargo, it says my investigation has been completed and closed. My money can only be return if other bank ( scammer 's account bank ) return the money to wellsfargo, otherwise my money gone and no way to got it back because it's authorized by me means it's on me. But, i think i was tricked or induced. 
5.then, i found a video on XXXX : XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, it says there is law called "" regulation E '' - if someone induced me to transfer the money even if i agreed to it, my bank should reimburse me. so, i contact to bank 's customer service, and they said regulation E only valid when bank didn't finish investigation. but for my case, it has been completed. 
So, i am confused about if Regulation E can be used in my case. i need a clearly explaination why Regulation E can be used in cases in video but not in my case."

When I was a college student in XXXX, I was pressured into getting a credit card as I had no money and no steady income. I was told I would be assisted and helped out throughout the way but I wasn't informed that I had to pay it back ( I was very misinformed about how credit cards worked but still was talked into opening one ). Being a special needs college student I couldn't get a job and I didn't have family support so I had no income or way to make payments on my card. I had considered using my tax return to pay off all of it even if it would leave me with nothing. But I was told not to by the person who was helping me manage at the time. It took about a year of trying to ignore the problem because I called and tried to get something established but the person I talked to seemed to not believe anything I said regarding why I'm unable to manage this card and I was told that theres no point in closing the account because it won't stop the fees and charges from coming and nothing could be done. I had daily anxiety and panicked every time I considered checking my bank account. It took another adult to get me somewhere with the account after calling multiple times. I knew nothing and regardless, they didn't warn me of anything I encountered and pretty much told me I was screwed."

The first is the company of the ATM company inside the XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX. I took out XXXX XXXX  from my debit card that belongs to Wellsfargo. After I used this ATM someone duplicated my debit card and was able to use copy the card number and pin. This took place on Tuesday at XXXX  XX/XX/2023 and then Thursday at XXXX XXXX  I received a text alert that my account had a possible {$460.00} attempt to be taken out of my card at a ATM .Wellsfargo was called to cancel and they would not divulge the address where the ATM was located. So I looked up the amount on my Wellsfargo online account and i found an address associated with all of the attempted charges. This address was at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX. The customer service at Wellsfargo should know this easily but told me he could not see an address associated with the XXXX  even though it turned out to be one of theirs. I visited the bank and they would not even look at their cameras to get a picture or license plate number of the person who was there for 15 different tries on my card to get XXXX dollars then they tried XXXX then XXXX dollars. When I visited the branch the Bank Manager stated that even they tried they were not successful so that there was no need to investigate anything. I told him that there should still be a suspicious activity report and to have someone view the footage ( incase there is license plate of a car ) a freeze frame of the person to see how they look like. Maybe even show it to the XXXX XXXX manager who have control of the ATM inside their store. I was told that there was not much that they could do and that they already cancelled my card so that I would get another and too just lower my daily limit to XXXX dollars. The associate that helped after the dreadful Bank Manager was better. She stated a police report would help more to have something on file and she did try to call their call center to see if there was anything more that could be reported. She was very nice and helpful in calming things down. 

There is someone out there or possibly a group still out there trying to get ahold of other people 's ATM cards if they got mine then they have other 's card information too. As they stood in front of that ATM for at least XXXX minutes trying to take out XXXX then XXXX then XXXX then XXXX out of my account I am sure they also tried other cards. Wellsfargo Manager did not want to take a look at their camera. I know that banks circulate pictures of suspicious people and bank robbers why can't they cooperate with the police on this as well? I will alos be filing a police report and will want someone to at least tell me they tried to look for the footage of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX from their ATM footage."
5/28/23,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,None,"Good evening, My husband and I obtained a fixed-rate conventional mortgage in early XXXX. Initially, our monthly mortgage was approx. {$2000.00}. For the last 4 years, Wells Fargo has sent us letters each year stating that we are behind in our escrow account. In late XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter stating that we are now {$4000.00} dollars behind in our escrow account which raised our mortgage to {$2600.00}. That is alot of money added to our monthly payments since we obtained our loan. We were only given 30 days until the payment adjusted. I have not ever had this happen before and I believe something unethical is occurring. We have a fixed loan so why has the mortgage adjusted by that amount? I'd like to request assistance on getting this resolved by having this investigated. Consumers obtain loans based on what they can afford and don't expect to be blindsided in this manner."
5/28/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Company closed your account,On XX/XX/23 I received a surprise call from Wells Fargo Bank and I was rudely told that my accounts were being closed effective XX/XX/23 due to a Wells Fargo Bank business decision.

I whole heartedly believe that Wells Fargo didnt even ATTEMPT to do any research before denying my claim. This is utterly ridiculous, and they should be ashamed of themselves for their deceit. Had they in fact did their job and investigated, they would see I have never signed up for this company and not have denied my claims. I am going to take this further if I do not get this resolved."

5/29/23,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Problem accessing account,"Wells Fargo representatives tell me that my account has thrown fraud alerts for a transaction that I did myself and I told them I did. I verified all the information about the transaction, and told them there is no fraud. My account is fine, I've not reported any fraud nor any unauthorized transaction. But they insist that the system has shown fraud activity. Then they asked if I had multiple devices, I explained that I use XXXX XXXX on my phone for security and privacy, and apparently the bank 's system don't like that, however, that's my right to watch for my security and privacy, and when I signed WF terms and conditions it doesn't say on our contract that I can not use XXXX XXXX to log into my account. 

Now they keep telling me that I have to step into a branch with a form of ID to get verified. I left the United States a few days ago and won't be back in several months. I've explained this situation to them and they keep telling me the same, they don't seem to even listen what I'm saying, they keep repeting the same message to me over and over. I called my personal banker at the WF branch with whom I opened my account, and she put a note on my account letting the security department that we talked but I'm not in the country and I can't go to the branch. I wonder if it is actually legal that WF prevent me to access my online banking just because I'm not in the United States at the moment. As my banker says, WF multiple ways to verify me over the phone. Then, they should do that. 

This is so discriminatory of Wells Fargo to punish XXXX XXXX like me by not letting them use their online banking because they can not step into a branch whenever WF wants."

At first, I was confused because no ones ever texted my number from XXXX  they would email, but then I thought it was legit because they had my contact information. They then sent me a link and said, if youre interested fill it out, I was asking them about the location and they kept saying its remote and then I asked them about it a second time just to make sure and they had an attitude and told me I said it was remote its from home, in an annoyed way and like I would only have to work three days out of the week from home and get paid XXXX weekly. After I had filled out the form they said great you start next week and I didnt hear from them for the next three days and then on Tuesday ( XXXX XXXX ) they had texted me about receiving a check from them. It was delivered around XXXX XXXX  and I was told I can cash it around XXXX XXXX, it was a {$4900.00} check. I had mobile deposited the check into my account because they said that was fine, I want to say about XXXX of it was supposedly released to me thats what I saw in my mobile app. They wanted me to immediately send it to somebody and send them Screen shots of it confirming I sent the money to that person. The person ( XXXX XXXX ). The bank had said the check will be held until the XXXX and then on the XXXX it said it will be held until the XXXX and on the XXXX it said the whole check was getting sent back and all my money was taken out of my account which left me in debt, and the money that I did have went to that person that I sent {$400.00} to. I asked them about it and they told me that I did something wrong with the account and they will send me the money to cover the debt and my weekly pay as well. They told me I would be receiving a check shortly and on ( XXXX XXXX ) I received another check with the same amount that was on the first check and different signature on it, this time I took it to my bank and they told me the check was fake and to not contact the scammer anymore and to block him.

I tried to dispute the closed claim and was shut down I tried to speak to the airline and they said that no one else could possibly use my cards with out authorization. Please help me to fix this. How is someone soppose to protect themselves if someone can get into the bank system and call from their number and send you an authorization code to speak with them from the bank. I have had my card info stolen before and the bank has been able to see that those transactions were clearly not me but this time they said that there was no information where these transactions originated from.
