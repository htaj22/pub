    "Hugging Face is a company that specializes in developing artificial intelligence models and tools for natural language processing (NLP). They are best known for their open-source library called Transformers, which offers pre-trained models and general-purpose architectures for various NLP tasks such as text classification, summarization, translation, and more. The library is built on top of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch."
